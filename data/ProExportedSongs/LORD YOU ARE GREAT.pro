Lord you're great
You're the great I AM
 
Pick up my cross and follow you
Lord you're great
 
You're the great I AM
We worship you in spirit and in truth
 
Authority and power in his hands
Accessed by faith to every man
 
Who gave his life
That we might be redeemed upon a tree
 
The Lord is great
 
And greatly to be praised.
 
He's the greatest
He's a great God
 
He's the greatest
He's the great I AM
 
You're the greatest, the Greatest
We are humbled at the cross
 
Where you were laid
You're the greatest, the greatest
 
The Lord is great
And greatly to be praise
