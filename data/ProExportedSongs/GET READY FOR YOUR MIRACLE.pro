It makes no difference what your going through,
you're going to make it, God's going to see you through.
 
Hold your head up, put a smile on your face,
this is another test, it won't last always.
 
I know you've been hurting deep down inside,
let me encourage you, it's going to be alright.
 
Troubles and trials come to make you strong,
keep on believing, you keep holding on.
 
(God's got a blessing), God's got a blessing.
(God's got a blessing), God's got a blessing.
 
(God's got a blessing), God's got a blessing.
(God's got a blessing), God's got a blessing.
 
Get ready for your blessing,
get ready for your miracle.
 
Get ready for your blessing,
get ready for your miracle.
