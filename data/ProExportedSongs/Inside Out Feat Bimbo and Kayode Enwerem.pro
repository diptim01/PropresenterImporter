Heaven and earth shall pass away
You’re the only God forever
 
We’ve come to sing for your glory
Give you the praises
 
You are God forever
 
O Jesus
We shout your name
 
We make it louder
From the inside out
 
Greater than the greatest
Wiser than all wisdom
 
Your light will shine in the darkness
 
Break every power
For you are God forever
 
Nothing can stand against us
We are victorious
 
Your name be lifted higher
Forever and ever
