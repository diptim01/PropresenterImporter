I can see that you are lost, I've come to find you
Even though you chose to leave and go your way
 
You thought you'd find more than what I could give you
So I let you go, still I want you to know
 
I've seen you struggle, I've seen you crying
Seen you do those things you swore you would never do
 
Your guilty soul has got you slowly dying
What you're running from, you should run to
 
Open up your heart to me, and I will set you free
OPen up your eyes and see, I'm everything you need
 
OPen up your mind and know, I'll never let you go
It won't be hard for you to believe if you open up your heart to me
 
ou turn here and there for the things to to make you happy
You're on a high but then you crash when those things tear you apart
 
Your broken heart needs my love that's real, and you will find
A touch from heaven is what will heal, that touch is mine
 
You can start again if you....
 
Open up your heart to me, and I will set you free
OPen up your eyes and see, I'm everything you need
 
OPen up your mind and know, I'll never let you go
It won't be hard for you to believe if you open up your heart to me
 
And if yours does fail you, you will find your strength in me
If you fall or lose your place you'll still be safe with me
 
Come out of the darkness into light so you can see
I died for you, you must believe, and open up your heart
 
Open up your heart to me, and I will set you free
OPen up your eyes and see, I'm everything you need
 
OPen up your mind and know, I'll never let you go
It won't be hard for you to believe if you open up your heart to me
