What a powerful Name it is The Name of Jesus
 
Death could not hold You
The veil tore before You
 
You silenced the boast of sin and grave
The heavens are roaring
 
The praise of Your glory
For You are raised to life again
 
You have no rival
You have no equal
 
Now and forever God You reign
Yours is the kingdom
 
Yours is the glory
Yours is the Name above all names
 
What a powerful Name it is
What a powerful Name it is
 
The Name of Jesus Christ my King
What a powerful Name it is
 
Nothing can stand against
What a powerful Name it is
 
The Name of Jesus
 
What a powerful Name it is The Name of Jesus
 
What a powerful Name it is The Name of Jesus
