All my troubles
I'll leave behind
 
All my troubles
I'll leave behind
 
Trade my sorrow
For peace of mind
 
All my troubles
I'll leave behind
 
I'm not waiting
Until I die
 
I'm not waiting
Until I die
 
To lift my praises
Up to the sky
 
I'm not waiting
Until I die
 
I'm going to heaven
To sing my song
 
I'm going to heaven
To sing my song
 
Dance with the angels
'Til eternity dawns
 
I'm going to heaven
To sing my song
 
Ha la la la la le lu ia
Ha la la la le lu ia
