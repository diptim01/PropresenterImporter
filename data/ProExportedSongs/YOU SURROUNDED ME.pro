YOU SURROUNDED ME
WITH SONGS OF PRAISE
 
YOU HAVE BROUGHT
ME TO THIS PLACE
 
WHERE YOUR
LOVE AND GRACE
 
MOVE WITHIN MY LIFE
NOW YOUR MESSAGE FILLS MY LIFE
 
I AM PLANTED
HERE BY THE WATERS
 
AND, I AM LIVING
FOR THE KING
 
I HAVE FOUND MY
FEET IN THE HOUSE  OF GOD
 
THIS IS I'M MEANT TO BE
 
YOUR LOVE IS
BEAUTIFUL  (2X)
 
IT'S THE REASON WHY I SING
ALL AROUND THE WORLD LET THE PRAISE BEGIN
