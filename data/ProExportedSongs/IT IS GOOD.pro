It is good (3x) To give thanks to you. (2x)
For though the wicked spring up like the grass and are everywhere, soon they will perish, but all those planted in your house will grow without end
 
For though we struggle and trails and trouble still come our way, you won√≠t forsake us, you word has told us your promises will never end
 
It is good (3X) To give thanks to the Lord on high.
,To sing of your faithfulness and loving-kindness both day and night,To play on our instruments sweet songs of praise for the things you do,
