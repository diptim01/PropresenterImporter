Chante eh eh,
Chante eh eh,
 
Chante eh eh,
Chante eh eh,
 
When you see the birds, flying high up in the sky,
All of them dey like to chante,
 
And when you see the trees,
The breeze dey blow them all around,
 
All of them dey like to chante,
You say you worship a God, your eyes cannot see.
 
But you surely stand alone
If you do not believe in me,
 
I made the heavens and the earth,
I made the sky, I made the sea,
 
I made the universe and everything
Therein bounds to me.
 
O Lord, I pray you shall not destroy humanity,
If you will only see the rainbow in me, Oh-o.
 
This is why me I dey Chante
Anywhere, everywhere where I dey
 
From the Monday to the Sunday
Na Otutu habane Se
 
See I'm nothing without you
And we are so hopeless and helpless without you
 
So we Chante Halleluyah oyo'o
And we Halle chante halle halli
 
When you wake up in the morning sun
Give praise to Jehovah alive
 
Chante Halleluyah oyo'o
You Halle chante halle halli
 
When you wake up in the morning sun
I will Give praise unto Jehovah for life
