Sometimes I talk a little too much
Don't listen enough
 
Sometimes it's way too easy for me
to beat myself up
 
Sometimes I hate the way I look when I look in the mirror
 
One look from you I know
 
My flaws
You love, you love my flaws
 
Think they make me beautiful
You don't see them as flaws at all
 
That's why
That's why, that's why I love you
 
Cause you are, you are the one who
The one who loves my flaws
 
Sometimes I get a little unsure
A lot insecure
 
Sometimes I know I might say some words
That might cause some hurt
 
Sometimes I get in my own way
I'm way too much to put up with
 
But you put up with it all
 
You think I'm everything
when I think I'm nothing
 
When I hate myself you still love me
 
Love me and
My flaws
 
You love, you love my flaws
Think they make me beautiful
 
You don't see them as flaws at all
 
My flaws
You love, you love my flaws
