This is my desire:
to honour YOU Lord with all my heart
 
I worship YOU
With all I have within me
 
I give YOU praise
All that I adore is in YOU
 
LORD, I give YOU my heart,
I give YOU my soul, I live for YOU alone
 
Every breathe that I take, Every moment I'm awake
Have YOUR way in me
 
Have YOUR way in me
