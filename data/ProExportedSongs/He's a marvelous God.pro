He's a Wonderful Saviour to Me
 
I was lost in sin,
But Jesus rescued me.
 
He's a wonderful Savior to me.
I was bound by fear,
 
But Jesus set me free.
He's a wonderful Savior to me.
 
He's a friend so true,
So patient and so kind.

Ev'rything I need in Him I always find.

To comfort and to cheer.

Dearer grows the love
Of Jesus day by day,

Sweeter is His grace,
 
While pressing on my way.
He's a wonderful Savior to me.
 
For He's a wonderful Savior to me,
He's a wonderful Savior to me.
 
I was lost in sin,
But Jesus took me in.
 
He's a wonderful Savior to me.
