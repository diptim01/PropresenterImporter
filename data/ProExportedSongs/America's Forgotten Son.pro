Our country needs the Savior now!
It's not too late.
 
It's time to hold onto freedom, before it drifts away.
Time to remember, in whom we put our trust.
 
Before America's forgotten Son is Jesus.
 
Oh, beautiful for spacious skies
For amber waves of grain.
 
For purple mountain's majesty,
Above Thy fruited plain
 
Oh beautiful for heroes proved
In liberating strife,
 
Who more than self, their country loved
And mercy more than life.
 
America, America, God has shed,
Has shed His grace on thee
 
I love this land, where justice stands
By faith in liberty.
 
America, America
God shed His grace on thee.
 
And crown thy good with brotherhood
From sea to shining sea.
 
America, America,
May God thy gold refine,
 
Till all success be nobleness
And every gain divine
 
America, America,
God shed His grace on thee.
 
And crown thy good with brotherhood
From sea to shining sea.
 
Ending 1:
It's time to remember in Whom we put our trust
 
Before America's forgotten son is Jesus.
