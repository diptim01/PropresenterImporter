Oh Lord my God
I exalt You
 
Lord
 
LORD I give my life toYOU
 
LORD I give my life to  YOU
Because YOU gave YOUR life for me
 
No Other can do the things YOU've done for me
Oh, Oh, Oh,
 
I can not deny YOUR love for me
How can I breathe
 
The Joy YOU give to me
I can not but say thank YOU
 
Oh, Oh, Oh (4X)
Oh, Oh, Oh (2X)
 
Oh, Oh, Oh
 
LORD I give my life to  YOU
