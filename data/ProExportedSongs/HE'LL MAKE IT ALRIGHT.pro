OH WHAT HE'S DONE FOR ME
 
KEEP ON MAKING A WAY FOR ME
ACCEPT ME
 
MY SOUL CRIES OUT
NOW IS THE TIME
 
KEEP THE FAITH

I'M GONNA WAIT
GO GET 'EM
 
YES I'M  GOING
SHOW THEM THE WAY
 
IF YOU BELIEVE(ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE)I NEED THE POWER
I'M YOURS
 
TIME AIN'T LONG
KING OF KINGS
 
I'LL LIFT YOU UP
WE COME TO PRAISE HIM
 
HOLY SPIRIT MOVIN'
GREAT GOD
 
HE'S BEEN GOOD
YOU'RE LOOKING AT A MIRACLE
 
IT PAYS
