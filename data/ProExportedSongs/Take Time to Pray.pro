On your knees
On your feet
 
Doesn't matter
Just get to it
 
Anything
In His name
 
You can ask Him
He will do it
 
If worry
Takes time from your prayers
 
Turn it around
Instead of holding on
 
Learn to let it go
Lay our burdens down
 
Pray for the lost
Pray for the dying world
 
At any cost
We've got to lay our lives down
 
Pray for the lost
Pray for the dying world
 
At any cost
We've got to lay our lives
 
Down for each other
Down for each other
 
Take time to pray
Take time to pray
 
Make time to pray
Take the time
 
Take time  Make time
Take time  To pray
 
Ending 1:
Take time
 
Make time
Take time to pray
 
(repeat 6x)
