Glorious lyrics (BJ Putnam)
 
Glorious
Shout it out and
 
Glorious
Make it louder
 
Jesus we shout Your name
Jesus we make Your praise
 
Glorious
You are glorious
 
My God You reign
Forever and ever
 
How great Your name
Your love remains
 
Forever and ever
You stay the same
 
Shout it out, shout it out
If you know Heâ€™s good
 
Sing it out, sing it out
For the Lord is good
 
Shout it out loud
You are glorious
 
Glorious
Shout it out and
 
Glorious
Make it louder
 
Jesus we shout Your name
Jesus we make Your praise
 
Glorious
You are glorious
 
Shine Jesus
You shine for all the world to see
 
You are glorious
 
You are glorious (You are glorious)
You are glorious (You are glorious)
 
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
 
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
 
Oh oh oh
God You are glorious
