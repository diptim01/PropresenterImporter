For You wear the Victor's crown
Let Your glory fill this temple
 
Let Your power overflow
By Your grace I live and breathe
 
To worship You.
 
Hallelujah
You have overcome, You have overcome
 
Hallelujah
Jesus You have overcome the world.
 
You are ever interceding
As the lost become the found
 
You can never be defeated
For You wear the Victor's crown
 
You are Jesus the Messiah
You're the Hope of all the world
 
By Your grace I live and breathe
To worship You.
 
Every high thing must come down
Every stronghold shall be broken
 
You wear the Victor's crown
You overcome, You overcome.
 
At the cross the work was finished
You were buried in the ground
 
But the grave could not contain You
For You wear the Victor's crown.
 
Every high thing must come down
Every stronghold shall be broken
 
You wear the Victor's crown
You overcome, you overcome.
