Turn And Pray For You To Heal Our Land
 
Father Let Revival Start In Us
Then Every Heart Will Know
 
Your Kingdom Come
 
Lifting Up The Name Of The Lord
In Power And In Unity
 
We Will See The Nations Turn
Touching Heavens Changing Earth
 
Never Looking Back We'll Run The Race
Giving You Our Lives We'll Win The Price
 
We Will Take The Harvest Given To Us
Though We Sow In Tears We'll Reap In Joy
 
Send Revival

Touching Heavens Changing Earth...
