When I need a friend
Troubles got me down
 
I'll depend on Jesus
To be my solid ground
 
When I feel afraid
The world takes away my smile
 
I'll look to Jesus
He makes it all worth while
 
When you need a friend
And troubles got you down
 
Depend on Jesus
To be your solid ground
 
ONLY THE LORD OF LOVE
 
Cause I know someday, very soon
He'll open up the skies
 
He will take me home
So when skies of gray come into my day
 
I will turn to God above and depend upon His love
 
Only the Lord of love
Only the God of grace
 
Only the name above all names
Could save me, save me.
 
Only the Lord  of love
Only the God of grace
 
Only the name above all names
Only Jesus
