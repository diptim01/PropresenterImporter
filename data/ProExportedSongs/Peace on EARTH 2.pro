A long time ago in a Beth-le-hem town
The Lord from hea-ven to earth came down
 
The King of kings was born in a man-ger
Now we can sing what the an-gels sang
They sang …
 
Glo-ry, glo-ry in the high-est
Peace on earth, good-will to all men
 
Glo-ry, glo-ry in the high-est
Peace on earth, peace on earth
 
Peace on earth, peace on earth
Good-will t'ward men
 
Oh, He shall be called the name of Je-sus
Prince of peace, our God is with us
 
The chains of sin and death are gone now
Joy to the world, the Lord is come
They sang …
