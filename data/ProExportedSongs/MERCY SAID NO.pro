I WAS JUST A CHILD
WHEN I FELT MY
 
SAVIOUR'S LEADING
I WAS DRAWN
 
TO WHAT I COULD
NOT UNDERSTAND
 
FOR THE CAUSE OF
CHRIST, I HAVE SPENT
 
MY DAYS BELIEVING
THAT WHAT HE'LL HAVE
 
ME BE IS WHO I AM
BUT AS I'VE COME TO SEE
 
THE WEAKER SIDE OF ME
I REALIZE HIS GRACE
 
IS WHAT I'LL NEED
WHEN SIN DEMANDS
 
JUSTICE FOR MY SOUL
 
GOD SO LOVED
THE WORLD
 
THAT HE SENT HIS
SON TO SAVE US
 
FROM THE CROSS
HE BUILT A BRIDGE
 
TO SET YOU FREE
OH BUT DEEP
 
WITHIN MY HEART
THERE IS STILL WAR
 
THAT I'M WAGING
THAT MAKES THE
 
SACRIFICES SO
HARD TO SEE
 
AS MIDNIGHT FELL ON CRUCIFIXION DAY
THE LIGHT OF HOPE SEEN
 
OH SO FAR AWAY
AS EVIL TRIED TO STOP REDEMPTION'S FLOW
 
MERCY SAID NO
I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU GO
 
I'M NOT GONNA LET
YOU SLIP AWAY
 
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO BE AFRAID
 
MERCY SAID NO
SIN WILL NEVER
 
TAKE CONTROL
LIFE AND DEATH STOOD
 
FACE TO FACE
DARKNESS TRIED TO
 
STEAL MY HEART AWAY
THANK YOU JESUS
 
MERCY SAID NO
 
AND NOW WHEN
HEAVEN LOOKS AT ME
 
ITS THROUGH THE
BLOOD OF JESUS
 
REMINDING ME OF
ONE DAY LONG AGO
