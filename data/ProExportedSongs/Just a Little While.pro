Soon this life will all be over,
And our pilgrimage will end,
 
Soon we'll take our heav'nly journey,
Be at home again with friends.
 
Heav'ns gates are standing open
Waiting for our entrance there,
 
Some sweet day we're going over,
All the beauties there to share.
 
Soon we'll see the light of morning,
Then the new day will begin,
 
Soon we'll hear the Father calling,
"Come My children enter in,"
 
Then we'll hear a choir
Of angels singing out the vict'ry song,
 
All our troubles will be ended,
And we'll live with heaven's throng.
 
Soon we'll meet again our loved ones
And we'll take them by the hand,
 
Soon we'll press them to our bosom,
Over in the promise land,
 
Then we'll be at home forever
Thro'out all eternity,
 
What a blessed, blessed morning,
That eternal morn will be.
 
Just a little while to stay here,
Just a little while to wait,
 
Just a little while to labor
In the path that's always straight,
 
Just a little more trouble,
In this low and sinful state,
 
Then we'll enter heaven's portals,
And go sweeping thru the pearly gates.
