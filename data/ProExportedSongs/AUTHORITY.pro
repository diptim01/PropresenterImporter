I'm taking Authority
Over what God promised me
 
My fear has been erased
And i'm walking in a wealthy place
 
I'm walking in victory
The plan God has for me
 
Mydreams have been restored
And I'm making room for more
 
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh(x4)
 
The chains are broken
I'm who God says i am
 
I'm never defeated
I'm who God says i am
 
Yes,Yes
I'm who God says I am
 
Yes-Yes-Yes â€¦..
 
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
