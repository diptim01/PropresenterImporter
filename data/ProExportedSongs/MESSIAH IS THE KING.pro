Michael W. Smith - Grace
 
I was lost when You found me here
You pulled me close and held me near
 
And I'm a fool but still You love
I'll be a fool for the king of love
 
He gave me wings so I could fly
And gave me a song to color the sky
 
And all I have is all from You
And all I want is all of You
 
It's grace, your grace, I'm nothing without You
Your Grace, Your grace Shines on me
 
And there've been days when I've walked away
Too much to carry, nothing left to say
 
I was lost when You found me here
Forgive me Lord when I'm weak and lost
 
You traded heaven for a wooden cross
And all these years You've carried me
 
You've been my eyes when I could not see
And beauty grows in the driving rain
 
Your oil of gladness in the times of pain
 
Your grace, Your grace I'm nothing without You
Your Grace, Your grace Shines on me 2x oh yeah
 
Shines on me, shines on me Your Grace Shines on me
Shines on me, shines on me It's Your grace 2x
