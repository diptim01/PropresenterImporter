For Your Glory"
 
Lord if I
Find favor in Your sight
 
Lord please
Hear my hearts cry
 
I'm desperately waiting
To be where You are
 
I'll cross the hottest desert
I'll travel near or far
 
For Your glory
I will do anything
 
Just to see You
To behold You as my King
 
I wanna be where You are
I gotta be where You are
 
I wanna be where You are
I gotta be where You are
