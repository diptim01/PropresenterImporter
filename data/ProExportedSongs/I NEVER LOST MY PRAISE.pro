I've lost some good friends along life's way some loved ones departed in heaven to stay but thank God i didn't lose everything. I've lost faith in people who said they cared in time of my crisis they were never there but in my disappointment,in my season of pain one thing never wavered, one thing never changed.
 
My praise still here,
My praise still here.
 
I've let some blessing slip away when I lost my focus and went astray, but thank God I didn't lose everything. I lost possessions that were so dear. I lost some battles walking in fear, but in the midst of my struggles, in my season of pain, one thing never wavered, one thing never changed.
 
I never lost my hope,
I never lost my joy
 
I never lost my faith
but most of all , I never lost my praise
