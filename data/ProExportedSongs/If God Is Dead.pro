If God is dead, tell me who suspends the stars in the sky, hey!
 
If God is dead, tell me who suspends the stars in the sky, hey!
 
If God is dead, then who told the moon where to hide!
 
If God is dead, who separates the day and the night
 
My God is not dead, 'cause I can see Him everyday
 
I can see Him in the mountain
 
Feel Him in the wind
See Him in my baby
 
Anytime he calls me daddy
I can see Him and Your eyes watching over me
 
Just a wink will make all things alright
