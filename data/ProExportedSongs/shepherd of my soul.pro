SHEPHERD OF MY SOUL
I GIVE YOU FULL CONTROL
 
WHEREVER YOU MAY LEAD
I WILL FOLLOW
 
I HAVE MADE THE CHOICE
TO LISTEN TO YOUR VOICE
 
WHEREVER YOU MAY LEAD
I WILL GO
 
BE IT IN THE QUIET PASTURES
BY THE GENTLE STREAM
 
SHEPHERD OF MY SOUL
IS BY MY SIDE
 
THOUGH I FACE THE
MIGHTY MOUNTAINS
 
VALLEYS DARK AND DEEP
THE SHEPHERD OF MY SOUL WILL BE MY GUIDE
 
THE SHEPHERD OF MY
SOUL WILL BE MY GUIDE...
