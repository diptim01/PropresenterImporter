God rest ye merry gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay
 
Remember Christ the Savior
was born on Christmas day
 
To save us all from Satan's pow'r
When we had gone astray
 
O tidings of comfort and joy
comfort and joy!
 
O tidings of comfort and joy!
 
O tidings of comfort and joy
comfort and joy!
 
O tidings of comfort and joy!
 
From God our Heav'nly Father
A blessed angel came
 
And unto certain shepherds
Bro't tidings of the same
 
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by name
