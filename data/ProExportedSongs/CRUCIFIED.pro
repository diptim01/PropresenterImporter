ABOVE ALL KINGDOMS
ABOVE ALL THRONESABOVE ALL WONDERS
 
THE WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN
ABOVE ALL WEALTH
 
AND TREASURES OF THE EARTHTHEREíS NO WAY TO MEASURE WHAT YOUíRE WORTH
 
CRUCIFIED!
LAID BEHIND A STONE, YOU LIVED TO DIE
 
REJECTED AND ALONE
LIKE A ROSE TRAMPLED ON THE GROUND
 
YOU TOOK THE FALL
AND THOUGHT OF ME...
 
ABOVE ALL
 
Ending 1:
 
AND THOUGHT
OF ME...
 
ABOVE ALL!

OUR GOD HAS COME TO
 
SET HIS PEOPLE FREE!
