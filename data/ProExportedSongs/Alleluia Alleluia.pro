Alleluia! Alleluia!
Hearts to heaven and voices raise;
 
Sing to God a hymn of gladness,
Sing to God a hymn of praise.
 
He who on the cross as Savior,
For the world's salvation bled;
 
Jesus Christ the King of glory,
Now is risen from the dead.
 
Now the iron bars are broken,
Christ from death of life is born;
 
Glorious life and life immortal,
Christ has triumphed,
 
And we conquer
By His mighty enterprise;
 
We with Him to life eternal,
By His ressurection rise.
