Can you hear the sound of heaven
Like the sound of many watersIts the sound of worsip coming from His throne
 
There are cries of adoration as men from every nation
Lift their voice to make His glory known
 
Holy, holy, holy are you Lord (2x)
The elders and angel bowThe redeemed worship you now
 
Holy, holy, holy are you Lord
