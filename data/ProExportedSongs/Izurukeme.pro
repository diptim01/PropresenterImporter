I’ve a message from the Lord, hallelujah!
 
I’ve a message from the Lord, hallelujah!
This message unto you I’ll give,
 
’Tis recorded in His word, hallelujah!
It is only that you “look and live.”
 
“Look and live,” my brother, live,
Look to Jesus now, and live;
 
’Tis recorded in His word, hallelujah!
It is only that you “look and live.”
 
I’ve a message full of love, hallelujah!
A message, O my friend, for you,
 
’Tis a message from above, hallelujah!
Jesus said it, and I know ’tis true. [Refrain]
 
Life is offered unto you, hallelujah!
Eternal life thy soul shall have,
 
If you’ll only look to Him, hallelujah!
Look to Jesus who alone can save. [Refrain]
 
I will tell you how I came, hallelujah!
To Jesus when He made me whole—
 
’Twas believing on His name, hallelujah!
I trusted and He saved my soul. [Refrain]
