Up Calvary's mountain one dreaded morn,
Walked Christ my Savior, weary and worn.
 
Facing for sinners, death on the cross,
That He might save them from endless loss.
 
"Father forgive them," thus did He pray.
E'en while His life-blood flowed fast away.
 
Praying for sinners while in such woe.
No one but Jesus ever loved so.
 
O how I love Him, Savior and friend.
How can my praises ever find end?
 
Through years unnumbered on heaven's shore,
My tongue shall praise Him forevermore.
 
Blessed Redeemer, precious Redeemer.
Seems now I see Him on Calvary's tree.
 
Wounded and bleeding, for sinners pleading.
Blind and unheeding, dying for me.
