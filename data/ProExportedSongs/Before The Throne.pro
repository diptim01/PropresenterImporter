Before the throne is where we come
to offer praise and seek wisdom
 
You have torn the veil that separates
No more outside now in Your grace.
 
Before the throne is where we come
to offer praise and seek wisdom
 
You have torn the veil that separates
No more outside now in Your grace
 
So we bow as we enter the throne room
And we cast ourselves down at Your feet
 
We cry holy, thou art holy, there is none like thee.
In Your presence is where we must be
 
Prepare our hearts for service now
 
When we fall short please show us how
Guide us with Your truth, ancient of days
 
Renew our hearts and cleanse our way
 
So we bow as we enter the throne room
 
And we cast ourselves down at Your feet
We cry holy, thou art holy, there is none like thee
 
In Your presence is where we must be
 
So we bow as we enter the throne room
And we cast ourselves down at Your feet
 
We cry holy, thou art holy, there is none like thee
In Your presence is where we must be
 
In Your presence is where we must be [x9]
