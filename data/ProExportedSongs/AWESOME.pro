My God is Awesome
He can move mountains
 
Keep me in the valley
Hide me from the rain
 
My God is Awesome
Heals me when I'm broken
 
Strength where I've been weakened
Forever He will reign...
 
My God is Awesome
Savior of the whole world
 
Giver of Salvation
By His stripes I am healed
 
My God is Awesome
Today I am  forgiven
 
His grace is why I'm living
Praise His Holy name
 
He's Mighty, He's Mighty
He's Mighty, He's Mighty
Awesome..
 
He's Holy, He's Holy
He's Holy, He's Holy
