Oh Thou who knowest my beginning
Thou who created the plan
 
who orchestrated my life's journey
God, You are my God
 
God of decisions, Creator of answers
Thou who ordained my way
 
through my transition, held my position
God, You are my God
 
I will forever give You praise
honor and celebrate Your name
 
God of the past, present, and Who is to come;
oh (God, You are my God)
 
(I will) forever give You praise
(honor and) celebrate Your name
 
(God of the) past, present, and Who is to come
God, You are my God
 
(I will) forever give You praise
(honor and) celebrate Your name
 
(God of the) past, present,
and Who is to come,
Who is to come...
 
Whatever You do with (me) it's alright,
(You have my total trust), You have my trust.
 
(Glory and) honor, (dominion and) power;
(God, You are my God).
 
God, oh God,
You are the only wise God.
 
(Oh Thou who knowest my beginning),
(God, You are my God).
 
God, You are my God.
