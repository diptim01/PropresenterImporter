GOD IS GOOD
WE SING AND SHOUT IT
 
GOD IS GOOD
WE CELEBRATE
 
GOD IS GOOD
NO MORE WE DOUBT IT
 
GOD IS GOOD
WE KNOW IT'S TRUE
 
AND WHEN I THINK OF
HIS LOVE FOR ME
 
MY HEART FILLS
WITH PRAISE
 
AND I FEEL LIKE DANCING
FOR IN HIS
 
HEART THERE
IS ROOM FOR ME
 
AND I RUN WITH
ARMS OPEN WIDE
 
GOD IS GOOD
WE KNOW IT'S TRUE
