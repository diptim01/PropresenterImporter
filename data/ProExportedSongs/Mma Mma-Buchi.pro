Not knowing what to say
I thought and thought about the good, good things
 
He has done for me
I thought about my pretty wife
All I could think of to say was
 
Thank you, Jesus
I'm saying
 
When we get to heaven
I know I'll see Jesus
Paul and Silas and Abraham
 
The whole a dem will be there
Many things I want to say
 
But first of all I will go to Him and say
Thank You Jesus
