I've had my share of ups and downs,
times when there was no one around,
 
God came and spoke these words to me,
praise will confuse the enemy.
 
I started singing, I started clapping,
I started dancing, people were laughing,
 
They knew my problems, they knew my pain,
But I knew God would take them away.

That's why I praise him with my hands
that's why I praise him with a dance
 
He's given me a second chance
come on lets praise him in advance.
