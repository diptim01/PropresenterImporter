In this race that we run you gotta have endurance cause its a marathon,
 
I was born sho nuff to win in pursuit with faith until the end.
 
I’m going to have a
strong finish, strong faith (4x)
 
Life transitions all in my way,
but still I'm onward bound, each and everyday,
 
No matter what I’ll continue to run,
for the rest of my life until my work is done
 
I’m going to have a
strong finish, strong faith (x4)
 
strong finish (5x’s)... strong faith
 
God promised he’d be with
me through every step
that I take,in this race,by his grace
 
Strong finish, strong finish, strong finish, strong finish, strong finish, strong faith
 
I’m going to have a
strong finish, strong faith (4x’s)
 
strong finish (5x’s)... strong faith
Oh…oh….oh…oh…oh….oh…oh...
