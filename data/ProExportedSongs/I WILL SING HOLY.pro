I will lift my voice and I will sing
I will sing Holy, Holy
 
To my Lord and Savior,
My God and king
 
I will sing Holy, Holy
 
All the angels sing and they bow down,
and they sing Holy, Holy
 
We Your sons and daughters,
we praise You now,
 
and we cry Holy, Holy!
 
I will praise the lamb of God who sits
upon the throne
 
I will worship Him and
give the praise to Him alone
 
He who was and is
and is to come
 
I will sing before His throne
forever, forever
 
HOLYâ€¦.HOLY
