Through test and trials, I've been through, You have been my place of Refuge, My shelter from the rain, My healer in times of pain, now i know for myself, You're everything that I need more.
 
Now I don't know, who he is to you, But to me he's first, In all I say and do, I can't explain, the way he makes me feel, But I dare you to try him, He's so real, Jesus
 
O Jesus, Jesus, Just give me Jesus,
Jesus, Please just give me Jesus. You can have this whole wide world, Just give me Jesus.
 
The man who died at calvary to save a wretch like you and me, Jesus, Just give me Jesus, Jesus. Just give me Jesus.
 
Jesus, Jesus (3x)
Oh, Jesus
 
Ending 1:
You can have this whole wide world just give me Jesus.
 
Jesus
 
Jesus (x12)
