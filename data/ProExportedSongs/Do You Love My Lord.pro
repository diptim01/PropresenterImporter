My soul feels happy
When I love my Jesus,
 
My soul feels happy
When I love my Lord:
 
I want to know, I want to know,
Do you love my Lord?
 
Makes me feel like shoutin'
When I love my Jesus,
 
Makes me feel like shoutin'
When I love my Lord:
 
I want to know, I want to know,
Do you love my Lord?
 
Makes us love each other
When we love my Jesus,
 
Makes us love each other
When we love my Lord:
 
I want to know, I want to know,
If you love my Lord?
 
Tell it on the mountain
That you love my Jesus,
 
Tell it on the mountain
That you love my Lord:
 
I want to know, I want to know,
Do you love my Lord?
 
Tell it in the valley
That you love my Jesus,
 
Tell it in the valley
That you love my Lord:
 
I want to know, I want to know,
Do you love my Lord?
 
Is there anybody here
That loves my Jesus?
 
Anybody here that loves my Lord?
I want to know, I want to know,
 
Do you love my Lord?
