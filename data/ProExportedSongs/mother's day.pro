In the morning you rise, the sun not yet high, To aÂ  your arm or the sound of a cry. The baby needs changing and to be fed
 
Healthy and tasty's the food that you cook
You never surrender to the dirt and the grime
Though you're sure that each day it takes more of your time
 
It's more than a job, what you do is an art
Showing kindness and love through the joy and the pain
You give all that you have with little to gain
 
Exhausted and spent from the day newly past. Your needs and desires you always put last. Repetitive, tiresome, boring, mundane, If these chores don't end you know no sleep
