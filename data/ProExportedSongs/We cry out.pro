Father of life seated on Your throne of Grace
Itâ€™s only by Your mercy
We are saved
 
Lord You have said
If we call upon Your name
We and our families will be saved!!!
 
So we cry out Your name,
El Shaddai, God of grace
 
Lord most High
Jesus Christ
 
We rely on your grace,
Adonai crowned in praise,
 
Lord most High
Jesus Christ
 
Father of love
Never failing to forgive
Each moment is a gift from You to live
 
We're only here to tell the world about Your grace
Until the day You take us all away
 
We declare War
 
Every Believer all over the world
wake up and realize,
 
Satan is busy destroying the world
right before our very eyes
 
Our children are killing our children,
Guns and knives terrorize our schools
 
We can't just stand here ; we can't accept ;
There's only one thing left for the believers to do
 
We declare war against the enemy
He is defeated Satan's under our feet
 
We cannot lose with the Lord on our side
Satan this is it; we're tired of taking it..
 
Satan we declare war
 
The enemy is cunning and his strategy
is sure on this you can depend
 
the devil hates it when we glorify God
he wants us to glorify him
 
that's why our music is losing its power,
worldly influence is making it sour
 
there's no gospel there's no annointing we cannot let this happen in this critical hour
 
Stand,fight,rise up
 
Blow the trumpet in Zion Zion [2x]
 
he is defeated the devil is defeated [2x]
 
blow the trumpet in Zion Zion [2x]
 
Stomp stomp stomp
stomp stomp on the devil [4x]
 
he is defeated,
the devil is defeated [2x]
 
I've got the victory,
I've got the victory [4x]
 
satan this is it,we're tired of taking it
satan we declare war!!!
