What A mighty God
He's a mighty God
 
What a Mighty God we serve
(X6)
 
What a mighty God we serve
What a mighty God we serve
 
Angels bow before Him
Heaven and earth adore Him
 
What a mighty God we serve
 
All the angels said it
Heaven and earth declare it
 
Lift your voice and say it
He's a mighty God
