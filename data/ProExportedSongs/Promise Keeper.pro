I heard it on the radio,
I saw it on the TV show, that you never fail,
 
That you can never fail,
I read it in the bible books; I see it everywhere I look,
 
That you never fail, age to age you’re still the same
 
Promise keeper (2x)
Your love will never fail, your promise you won’t break,
 
Promise keeper (2x)
Your love won’t fade away,
 
your promise you won’t break,
Promise keeper
 
And I did some research and found out you never fail,
I asked Moses in the bible he agreed you never fail,
 
I asked Abraham and Sarah and
they said you’re a promise keeper,
And I tried you for myself, guarantee you never fail
