More of You in my life
More of You in my life
 
I need Your Word
Much more than gold
 
If I could have everything
It would be more of You in my life
 
More of You in my life
More of You in my life
 
I need Your love
I need Your grace
 
I need Your wisdom
I need more of You in my life
 
More of You in my life
More of You in my life
 
This is my prayer
This is my hope
 
Those who are closest to me
That they would see
 
More of You in my life
 
More of You more of You
Knowing You is what I was made to do
 
Live in me help me see
Everything You want for me to be
 
More of You in my life
More of You in my life
 
More of You in my life
More of You in my life
