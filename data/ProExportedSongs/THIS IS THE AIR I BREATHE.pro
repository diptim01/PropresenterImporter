This is the air I breathe
This is the air I breathe
 
Your holy presence
living in me
 
This is my daily bread
This is my daily bread
 
Your very word
spoken to me
 
And I, I'm desperate for you
And I, I'm lost without you
 
This is the air I breathe
This is the air I breathe
 
Your holy presence
living in me
 
This is my daily bread
this is my daily bread
 
your very word
spoken to me
 
And I'm, I'm desperate for you
And I'm, I'm lost without you
 
And I….. I'm desperate for you
And I….. I'm lost without you.
 
I'm lost without you.
I'm lost without you.
 
I'm desperate for you.
 
This is my daily bread
This is my daily bread
 
Your very word spoken to me
 
And I'm, I'm desperate for you
And I'm, I'm lost without you
