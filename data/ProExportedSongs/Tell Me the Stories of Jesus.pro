Tell me the stories
Of Jesus I love to hear,
 
Things I would ask Him
To tell me if He were here:
 
Scenes by the wayside,
Tales of the sea
 
Stories of Jesus tell them to me.
 
First let me hear how,
The children stood round His knee;
 
And I shall fancy
His blessing resting on me:
 
Words full of kindness,
Deeds full of grace,
 
All in the lovelight of Jesus' face.
 
Into the city
I'd follow the children's band,
 
Waving a branch of palm tree
High in my hand.
 
One of His heralds,
Yes I would sing
 
Loudest hosanna's, Jesus is King!
 
Tell me in accents of wonder,
How rolled the sea,
 
Tossing the boat
In a tempest on Galilee;
 
And how the Master,
Ready and kind,
 
Chided the billows,
And hushed the wind.
