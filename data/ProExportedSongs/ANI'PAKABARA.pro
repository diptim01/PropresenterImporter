I understand that life
Can be tough and rough these days
 
Please no matter what happens
Don't give it up, don't give him up
 
There's a God whose on your side,
In his presence you can hide.
 
Oribalagbariye gbari gbalafama ñ
(He will take care of you, donít be afraid)
 
Can't u see those who put their trust in the lord
Shall be like mount Zion (mount Zion)
 
They're never moved, never moved, never moved
They're growing stronger, they're soaring higher,
 
Friend hang in there,
He's your master; he will answer you, you....
