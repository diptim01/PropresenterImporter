I will bless the Lord, Oh my soul
And all, all that is within me 4X
 
Just Think about it,
Take a minute and think about it
 
Where would you be, how would you live, what would you think about it
 
Just Think about it,
Take a minute and think about it
 
Blessings for days, way after way,
you ought to shout about it
 
Whatever happened yesterday, was yesterday
 
Right now you have a chance to make a change
 
Before you start to complain,
before you say another thing,
 
Make up, Your mind,
cause i’m gonna bless His name
 
I will bless the Lord, Oh my soul
And all, all that is within me 4X
 
Everybody clap your hands
 
I’m gonna give Him the praise for it
I’m gonna give Him the praise for it
 
I’m gonna give Him the praise for it
Can’t thank You enough
 
Thank You enough
 
I can't thank You enough
