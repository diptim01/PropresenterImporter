This is a call from the mountain of God
Tambira, tambira (let's dance)
 
To come with thanksgiving and  joy in our hearts
Tambira, tambira (let's dance)
 
Let's fill the streets with love
And shake this world alive with singing
 
The celebration's now
For our time to dance has come
 
Tambira, tambira (Let's dance)
Tambira Jehovah (Let's dance for God)
 
Imbira, imbira (Let's sing)
Imbira Jehovah (Let's sing for God)
 
Rumbidza, rumbidzai (Let's praise)
Rumbidza Jehovah (Let's praise God)
