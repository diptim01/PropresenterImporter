From the day I was born
To where I dey now
 
I never see Jehovah change in my life e e
My eyes don see
 
My mouth go talk am o o
The goodness of GOD
 
In the land of the living e e
 
Anywhere I look o
Anywhere I turn o
 
Wetin I dey see
Na so so goodness e dey follow me
 
Nnee anya na irum
(When I look in front)
 
Nnee anya na azum
(When behind me)
 
Agam ahu
(I will see)
 
Ihem ga eji wee jaa CHINEKE nma
(Reasons to give YOU praise)
 
When I look in frontie e e
When I look at my back e e
 
Wetin I dey see
Agama wu
