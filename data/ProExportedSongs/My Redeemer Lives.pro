I know He rescued my soul
 
His Blood has covered my sin
 
I believe,
I BELIEVE!
 
My shame is taken away
 
My pain is healed in His NAME
 
I believe,
I BELIEVE!
 
I'll raise a banner
 
My LORD has conquered the grave
 
My REDEEMER lives...
 
You lift my burdensâ€¦ I'll rise with You
 
I'm dancing on this mountain top
 
To see Your kingdom come
