You can depend on God
Even in a world
 
Where nothing lasts forever
God does
 
You can depend on God
When He says He loves you
 
He does
 
You can depend on God
Even when you fall
 
When you think you've gone too far
You can depend on God
 
'Cause when you are forgiven
You are
 
His love is never gonna leave you
His love will always stay
 
His love is never gonna leave you
His love will never go away
