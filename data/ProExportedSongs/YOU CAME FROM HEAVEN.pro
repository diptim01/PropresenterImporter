LORD I LIFT YOUR NAME ON HIGH
LORD I LOVE TO SING YOUR PRAISES
 
I'M SO GLAD YOU REIGN IN MY LIFE
I'M SO GLAD YOU CAME TO SAVE ME
 
YOU CAME FROM
HEAVEN TO EARTH
 
TO SHOW THE WAY
 
FROM THE EARTH
TO THE CROSS,
 
MY DEBT YOU PAID
 
FROM THE CROSS TO THE GRAVE
 
FROM THE GRAVE TO THE SKY
LORD I LIFT YOUR NAME ON HIGH
 
LORD I LIFT YOUR NAME ON HIGH...
 
Clap your hands
if you really love Jesus
 
E Gboruko Jesu Gaa oo
