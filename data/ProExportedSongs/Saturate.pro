There's nothing worth more
That could ever come close
 
No thing can compare
You're our living hope

Sweet Holy Spirit... sweet heavenly dove...
 
Stay right here with us
Filling us with Your love

With Your Word of truth
 
Oh oh Holy One
 
Saturate my soul
Fill me with Your love
 
Saturate my life
Fill it with Your power
 
Oh oh oh oh oh

Where else can I go
Who else can I call

In total surrender
I'm arrested by Your Grace
 
In total submission
I'm embraced by Your Warmth
