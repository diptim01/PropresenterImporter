Let the earth rejoice
 
GFH rejoice...
 
Nigeria rejoice...
 
Let the people be glad
That our God reigns
 
OUR GOD REIGN
 
A fire goes before Him
And burns up all His enemies
 
The hills melt like wax
At the presence of the Lord
At the presence of the Lord
 
The heavens declare his righteousness
The people see His glory
 
For You O Lord are exalted
Over all the earth
Over all the earth
