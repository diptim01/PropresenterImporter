I sought the Lord
And found God's faithfulness
 
I sought the Lord
And found God's grace
 
I sought the Lord
He gave His strength to me
 
Now I won't have to fear anymore
 
I sought the Lord
And found God's presence
 
I sought the Lord
And found God's love
 
I sought the Lord
And found His sovereignty
 
Now I won't have to fear anymore
 
I sought the Lord
(I sought the Lord)
 
I sought the Lord
(I sought the Lord)
 
He gave me all and more
Of what I was looking for
 
So glad (so glad) that I sought the Lord
 
Not one fear that starts to ember
In my heart can I afford
 
When I'm afraid I will remember
That my future is in the Lord
