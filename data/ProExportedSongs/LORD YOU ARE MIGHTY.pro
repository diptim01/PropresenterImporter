Oh Lord how excellent is Your
name in all the earth.
 
You set Your glory above
the heavens and the earth.
 
When I think of all You've made,
the sun the moon and the stars.
 
No praise is high enough
to express how great You are.
 
What a mighty God we serve.
Mighty God we serve.
 
Angels would bow before the mighty God we serve
What a mighty God we serve.
 
Mighty God we serve.
Let heaven and the earth adore
the mighty God we serve
 
Lord You're mighty
Lord You're mighty
 
Hallelujah (4x)
 
All glory, All honor
All praise! All praise!!
 
To the mighty God we serve.
Mighty God we serve.
 
Angels bow before the mighty God we serve.
 
Lord You're mighty
Lord You're mighty
 
What a mighty God we serve.
What mighty God we serve.
 
Angels bow before Him.
What a mighty God we serve.
