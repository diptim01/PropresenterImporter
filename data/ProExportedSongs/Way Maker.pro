You have the power to make the seasons change
The river flows for You,
the wind whispers Your name
 
For me You left Your throne and traded crown
for thorns instead I'm safe within not by Your
skin but because Your blood was red
 
Some say You're black, You're white, they question
if You're real We treat You like we treat ourselves,
I wonder how You feel
 
To see Your children fight inspite of the tears for us
You've shed Doesn't matter what color You are as
long as Your blood was red
 
For it's strong enough to wash away my sins
And it's pure enough to cleanse me deep within
 
And it's real enough to find me when I'm lost
Great enough to die upon the cross
 
doesn't matter what color You are as long as Your blood was red
 
We may be different but the God we
serve's the same Yet every Sunday we separate and bring the Father pain
 
Your name is higher than any other yet
You took my place instead And now my sins are
washed away because Your blood was red
 
For it's strong enough to wash away my sins
And it's pure enough to cleanse me deep within
 
And it's real enough to find me when I'm lost
Great enough to die upon the cross
 
Doesn't matter what color you are
As long as Your blood was red
 
O precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
 
Doesn't matter what color you are
As long as Your blood was red (x2)
 
Doesn't matter what color I am
As long as Your blood was red
