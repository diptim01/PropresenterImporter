Got a revelation sittin' in church one day
that God don't always call those who are qualified,
 
but He qualifies those whom He calls!
 
Favor ain't fair
Favor ain't fair
 
It's got my name on it
It's got my name on it
 
Favor ain't fair, but it sure feels fabulous
Livin' life ain't been nothin' but miraculous
 
He left the windows wide open,
and the blessings keep flowin'
 
God's got a little some-'in, some-'in
With my name on it, yeah!
 
Favor ain't fair, but it sure feels fabulous!
