I want to Praise You
I want to Worship You
 
I want to Lift Your name on High
You are my everything
 
The air I breathe, the Song I Sing
I want to Lift Your Name on High
 
You are my God
And I'm so lost without You
 
Cause I can't live without You in my life
 
You are my God
I could never repay You
 
with my heart I say Thank You for Who You are
 
We Worship You (10X)
We Bless Your Name (10X)
 
For Who You are
For Who You are
 
We worship You
Just for Who You are
