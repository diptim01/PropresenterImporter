When I think of all the things
GOD has brought me,
 
(marvelous in my eyes).
How HE took my
 
sin-stained soul
and made my life brand new,
 
(marvelous in my eyes).The LORD has kept me
from dangers seen and unseen,
 
(marvelous in my eyes).
HE gave me the victory
 
over all these things,
(marvelous in my eyes).
 
What the Devil meant for bad,
GOD used it to bless me,
 
(marvelous in my eyes).
HE even made footstools
 
out of my enemies,
(marvelous in my eyes).
 
HE has fought every battle
and every victory HE has won,
 
(marvelous in my eyes).
Oh, what a mighty GOD,
 
yes, You are the One,
(marvelous in my eyes).
 
It's the LORD's doing,
and it is simply marvelous
 
in my eyes.
