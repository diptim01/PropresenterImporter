I have listened to you, I heard your	 request,
I've come to tell you that it's only a test;
 
just hold on though your storm be strong,
just hold on, this test is your storm,
 
but it won't be long, go through, hold on.
 
So your daughter won't hear you,
your son could care less,
 
seems they've done all to hurt you, but it's only a test;
just hold on through your storm be strong,
 
and hold on, this test is your storm,
but it won't last long, go through, hold on.
 
I'm able to deliver,
hold on, hold on
 
I'm able, I can help you,
hold on, hold on.
 
I'm able, I can heal you,
hold on, hold on
 
Hold on...
Never the less,
 
it's only a test, hold on.
 
I have listened to you, I heard you request,
I've come to tell you that it's only a test;
 
just hold on though your storm be strong,
just hold on, this test is your storm,
 
but it won't be long, go through, hold on.
 
I have listened to you, I heard you request,
I've come to tell you that it's only a test;
 
just hold on though your storm be strong,
just hold on, this test is your storm,
 
but it won't be long, go through, hold on.
 
Don't you know the darkest time in your life is
just before the break of dawn.
 
All your battles I will fight if you just
just hold on, hold on, hold on.
 
Your tears have been plenty in the still of the night,
You've prayed, now your empty just to weak to fight.
 
Just hold on through your storm, be strong and hold on,
this test is your storm, but it won't be long,
 
go through, hold on.
 
You say you've been wounded,
you've given your best,
 
you've been misunderstood, but it's only a test,
This test is your storm,
 
it won't be long, go through, hold on.
