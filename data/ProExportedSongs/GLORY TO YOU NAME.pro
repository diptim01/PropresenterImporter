Glory to Your name oh LORD my GOD
As I lift up my hands I magnify Your name
 
Give you my heart, my mind, my soul
Oh LORD take control
 
Have Your way in me Oh LORD
 
Lord there is none
No one like You
 
Oh how we worship You in spirit and in truth
Come reign on me refresh my soul
 
Come down and fill this place
Come and breathe on me Oh LORD
 
We give You glory
We give You honour
 
We give You worship
All in this place
