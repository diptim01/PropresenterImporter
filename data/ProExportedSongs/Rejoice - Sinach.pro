I’m gonna dance and praise Him
It doesn’t matter what comes my way
 
The greater One lives inside of me
 
His name is Jesus
I’m born a winner
 
More than victorious
I’m a heir of the kingdom
 
Filled with the Holy Ghost
 
I rejoice in Him
I rejoice in Him
 
I rejoice in Him [3x]
More than a conqueror
 
Rejoice...
 
More than a conqueror
 
More than Victorious
 
Oh oh oh oh oh (3X)
 
No weapon formed against me
Shall ever prosper
 
The greater One lives inside of me
 
His name is Jesus
I’m born a winner
 
More than victorious
I’m a heir of the kingdom
 
Filled with the Holy Ghost
 
More than victorious
