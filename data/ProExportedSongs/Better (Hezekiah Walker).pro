People come…
People go…
 
Your life has been..
Out of control...
 
You're confused
Don't worry your soul
 
It will get better…. Better…(x2)
It will get better… God is in control...
 
Find your praise
Within your heart
 
Hold it close
Don't ever depart
 
It gets cold in the night
But you'll be alright
 
It will get better…. Better…(x2)
It will get better… God is in control...
 
Whatever state I find myself in
I learned how to be secure
 
Knowing that God
Will supply all my needs
 
And He'll work things out for my good
 
It will get better….Better….
 
God is in control….
