He's my joy, every morning,
He's my hope through the night,
 
The darkest night.
 
All that is God, is all that I need;
All that I need, is God.
 
All that is God,
Is all that I'm living for,
 
Yes to me to live is the Lord.
 
All that is God,
Is all that I need;
 
All that I need is God,
All that is God
 
Is all that I'm living for,
Yes to me to live,
 
Yes to me to live,
Yes to me to live is the Lord.
 
Yes to me to live is the Lord.
