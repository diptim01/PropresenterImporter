YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL BEYOND DESCRIPTION
TOO MARVELLOUS FOR WORDS
 
TOO WONDERFUL FOR COMPREHENSION
LIKE NOTHING EVER SEEN OR HEARD
 
WHO CAN GRASP YOUR INFINITE WISDOM?
WHO CAN FATHOM THE DEPTH OF YOUR LOVE?
 
YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL
BEYOND DESCRIPTION
 
MAJESTY
ENTHRONED ABOVE
 
I STAND, I STAND IN AWE OF YOU (2X)
HOLY GOD TO WHOM ALL PRAISE IS DUE
 
I STAND IN AWE OF YOU
 
HOLY GOD
TO WHOM ALL PRAISE IS DUE
 
I STAND IN AWE OF YOU...
I STAND IN AWE OF YOU
 
I STAND IN AWE OF
YOU...
