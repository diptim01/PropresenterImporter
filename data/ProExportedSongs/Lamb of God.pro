Your only son, no sin to hide
But you have sent him
 
From your side
To walk upon this guilty sod
 
And to become the Lamb of God
 
Your gift of love they crucified
They laughed and scorned him
 
As He died
The humble king they named a Fraud
 
And sacrificed the Lamb of God
 
O Lamb of God sweet Lamb of God
I love the holy Lamb of God
 
O wash me in your precious blood
My Jesus Christ the lamb of God
 
I was so lost i should have died
But you have brought me to Your side
 
To be lead by your staff and rod
And to be called a lamb of God
 
O lamb of God sweet lamb of God
I love the holy lamb of God
 
O wash me in your precious blood
Till i am just a lamb of God
