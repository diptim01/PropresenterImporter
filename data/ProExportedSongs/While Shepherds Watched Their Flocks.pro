While shepherds watched their flocks by night,
All seated on the ground;
 
The angel of the Lord came down,
And glory shone around,
 
And glory shone around,
 
"Fear not!" said he, for mighty dread
Had seized their troubled mind.
 
"Glad tidings of great joy I bring
To you and all mankind,
 
To you and all mankind.
 
"To you in David's town this day,
Is born of David's line,
 
A Savior, who is Christ, the Lord,
And this shall be the sign,
 
And this shall be the sign."
 
"The heavenly Babe you there shall find,
To human view displayed;
 
All simply wrapped in swaddling clothes,
And in a manger laid,
 
And in a manger laid."
 
Thus spake the angel,
Suddenly appeared a shining throng of angels praising God
 
Who thus addressed their joyful song,
 
Addressed their joyful song.
 
"All glory be to God on high,
And to the earth be peace.
 
To those on whom His favor rest
Good will shall never cease
 
Begin and never cease,
Begin and never cease."
