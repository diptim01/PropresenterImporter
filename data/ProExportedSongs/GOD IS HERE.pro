There is a sweet anointing in the sanctuary
There is a stillness in the atmosphere
 
Come and lay down the burdens you have carried
For in the sanctuary, God is here
 
He is here, he is here
To break the yoke and lift the heavy burden
 
He is here, He is here
To heal the hopeless heart and bless the broken
 
Come and lay down the burden
You have carried
 
For in this sanctuary, GOD is here
 
Speak LORD,
Speak LORD!
