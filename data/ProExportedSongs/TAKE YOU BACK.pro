The reason why I stand
The answer lies in you
 
You hung to make me strong
Though my praise was few
 
When I fall and bring your name down
But I have found in you
 
A heart that pleads forgiveness
Replacing all these thoughts of painful memories
 
But I know
That your response will always be
 
You satisfy this cry
Of what I'm looking for And I take all I can
 
And lay it down Before the throne of endless grace  now
That radiates what's true I'm in the only place that
 
Erases all these faults that have overtaken me
But I know  that your response will always be
 
I'll take you back
always and Even when your fight is over now
 
Even when your fight is over now I'll take you back
always and Even when the pain is coming through
 
Even when the pain is coming through
I'll take you back
 
I'll take you back
always and Even when your fight is over now
 
Even when your fight is over now I'll take you back
always andEven when the pain is coming through
 
Even when the pain is coming through
I'll take you back
 
You'll take me back
always and Even when my fight is over now
 
Even when my fight is over now You'll take me back
always and Even when my pain is coming through
 
Even when my pain is coming through
You'll take me back always
 
Even when my fight is over now
Even when my fight is over now
 
You'll take me back always
Even when my pain is coming through
 
Even when my pain is coming through
You'll take me back
 
I can only speak
With a grateful heart As I'm pierced by this gift
 
Of your love I will always bring an offering
I can never thank you enough
