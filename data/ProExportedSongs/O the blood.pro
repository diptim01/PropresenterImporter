O the Blood
Crimson love
 
Price of life's demand
Shameful sin
 
Placed on Him
The hope of every man
 
O the Blood of Jesus washes me
O the Blood of Jesus shed for me
 
What a sacrifice that saved my life
Yes the Blood it is my victory
 
Savior Son, Holy one
 
Slain so I can live
See the lamb
 
The great I am
Who takes away my sin
 
O the Blood of the lamb
O the Blood of the lamb
 
O the Blood of the lamb
The precious Blood of the lamb
 
What a sacrifice
That saved my life
 
Yes the Blood it is my victory
 
O what love
No greater love
 
Grace how can it be
That in my sin
 
Yes even then
He shed his blood for me
