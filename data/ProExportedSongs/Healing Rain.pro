Healing rain is falling down
Healing rain is falling down
 
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid...
 
The yoke is broken
The chains are falling
 
Dry bones are rising
Healing is right now
 
Right now
Right now
 
Right now
Healing is right now
 
Sickness, you can't stay no longer
By His stripes I have been healed and..
 
Jesus it's Your will that I am free
 
Right now
Right now
 
Right now
Healing is right now
 
Every high thing must come down and...
Every strong hold must be broken
 
Jesus it's Your will that I am free
 
Right now
Right now
 
Right now
Healing is right now
 
Healing rain is falling down (2x)
I'm not afraid (2x)
