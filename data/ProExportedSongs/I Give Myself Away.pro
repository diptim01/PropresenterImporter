My life is not my own
To You I belong
 
I give myself,
I give myself to You
 
Take my heart Take my life
As a living sacrifice
 
All my dreams all my plans
Lord I place them in Your hands
 
I give myself away
I give myself away
 
So You can use me
I give myself away
 
I give myself away
So You can use me
 
My life is not my own
To You I belong
 
I give myself,
I give myself to You
 
i give you the praise
