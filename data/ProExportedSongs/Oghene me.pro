Mountains high,Valley low
 
I have never seen the righteous forsaken
 
Through the night
Through the storm
 
I will lift my voice and call you God
 
Oghene meâ€¦.Oghene me
 
Oghene me
I worship You
 
Seasons come
Seasons go
 
I'll still lift my voice and call you God
 
Through the test
Through the trials
 
I'll lift my hands and call you my God
 
I worship You
I worship You
