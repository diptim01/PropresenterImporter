Merciful God and Father
Loving us like no other ...Hear our prayer
 
The cry of our heart
As we come to You
 
We acknowledge our transgressions
We confess to You our sins
 
Show us mercy and compassion
Touch our lives with Your healing grace
 
Release us from our past
As we seek Your face
 
Wash us free at lastâ€¦.We receive Your love
We receive Your healing grace
