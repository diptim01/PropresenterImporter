YOU'VE BEEN JUST WHAT I'VE NEEDED
YOU'VE BEEN MORE THAN MY HEART'S DESIRE
 
YOU'VE GONE SO FAR BEYOND
WHAT LOVE REQUIRES
 
MY LIFE, MY BREATH, MY HEARBEAT
YOUíLL ALWAYS BE MY ALL IN ALL
 
I FOUND THAT ITíS NOT HARD TO SAY IT ALL
 
YOUíRE THE ONE THAT I LIVE FOR
YOUíRE THE ONE I NEED
 
YOUíRE THE ONE
I ëLL ALWAYS WANT TO STAND BY ME
 
YOUíRE THE ONE THAT I LOOK FOR
IN THE MIDDLE OF MY STORM
 
WHEN I NEED SOMEONE TO HOLD ME
TO YOU I ëLL RUN, YOUíRE THE ONE
