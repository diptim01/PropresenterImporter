WHENEVER I CONSIDER
JUST WHERE GOD BROUGHT ME FROM
 
THE LIFE OF EMPTINEES
I LIVED WITHOUT GOD'S SON
 
MY HEART CRIES  HALLELUYAH
'COS THE SAVIOUR RESCUED ME
 
WITHOUT HIS PRECIOUS LOVE WHERE WOULD I HAVE BEEN
 
SINCE THE DAY HE SAVED ME
JUST LOOK WHERE I HAVE COME FROM
 
AND NOW I HAVE BEEN MADE INTO THE LIKENESS OF GOD'S SON
 
I HAVE THE BLESSED ASSURANCE
SINCE THE SAVIOUR RESCUED ME
 
WITHOUT HIS PRECIOUS LOVE WHERE WOULD I HAVE BEEN
 
I WOULD BE LOST
I WOULD BE DRIFTING LIKE A SHIP ON STORMY SEA
 
WITHOUT THE SACRIFICE THAT JESUS CHRIST AFFORDS
 
I WOULD BE DEAD WITHIN MY SIN FOREVER
LONGING TO BE FREE
 
IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THE GOODNESS OF THE LORD (2X)
 
JESUS BROUGHT ME OUT OF DARKNESS INTO HIS MARVELOUS LIGHT,
 
HE PLACED ME ONTHE SOLID ROCK TO STAY
AND NOW I'M WORKING WITH MY SAVIOUR
 
AND  I'M FIGHTING A GOOD FIGHT
BECAUSE OF JESUS I CAN TRULY SAY...
 
THE GOODNESS OF THE LORD
HE SAVED ME...
 
HE RAISED ME...
HE KEPT ME...
 
IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THE GOODNESS OF THE LORD...
