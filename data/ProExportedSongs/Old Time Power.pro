We are gathered for Thy blessing,
We will wait upon our God;
 
We will trust in Him who loved us,
And who bought us with His blood.
 
We will glory in Thy power,
We will sing of wondrous grace;
 
In our midst as Thou hast promised,
Come, O come and take Thy place.
 
Bring us low in prayer before Thee,
And with faith our souls inspire,
 
Till we claim by faith the promise
Of the Holy Ghost and fire.
 
Spirit, now melt and move
All of our hearts with love.
 
Breathe on us from above
With old time power.
