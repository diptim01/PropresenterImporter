Almighty God in heaven, i lift my voice to praise You
 
for all that You have done for me i just wanna testify
 
many are the afflictions of the righteous
 
but You promise to deliver
 
but if he falls down seven times
 
he shall rise again
 
for the Lord, He inhabits the praise that we bring
 
so let us bring praises to our King

when i look over the years
 
i can not help but marvel
 
i have seen Your hand guiding me through it all
 
and showing me the way
 
You have our help in ages past and our hope for tomorrow
 
You who began this good will surely take me to the very end

Come Holy Ghost Our Hearts Inspire
 
Come, Holy Ghost, our hearts inspire;
Let us Thine influence prove:
 
Source of the old prophetic fire,
Fountain of life and and love.
 
Love.
 
Come, Holy Ghost for moved by Thee
The prophets wrote and spoke.
 
Unlock the truth, Thyself the key;
Unseal the Sacred Book.
 
God, through Himself, we then shall know
If Thou within us shine,
 
And sound with all Thy saints below,
The depths of love divine.
