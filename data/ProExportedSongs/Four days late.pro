The news came to Jesus, please come fast,
Lazarus is sick and without your help he will not last,
 
and Martha watched their brother die,
They waited for jesus, he did not come, they wonder why?
 
The death watch was over, burried four days, Somebody said, he will soon be here, the lords on his way
 
Martha ran to Him and then she cried,
Lord if you had been here you could have heal him
 
he'd still be alive
 
But you're four days late
And all hope is gone
 
Lord we don't understand why you waited this long
But his way is Gods way not yours or mine
 
Isin't it great when he's four days late he's still on time
 
Jesus said to martha show me the grave
But she said lord you don't understand it's been four days
 
The grave stone was rolled back
Then jesus cried lazarus come forth then somebody said
 
he's alive he's alive
 
You may be fighting
A battle of fear
 
You cried to the lord i need ya help but he not appeared
Friend don't be discourage
 
Coz he's still the same
He'll soon be here
 
He'll roll back the stone and call out your name
 
When he's four days late and all hope is gone
Lord we don't understand why you waited so long
 
But his way is god's way not yours or mine
Isn't it great when his four days late he's still on time
 
oh... my God is great when he's four days late he's still on time... he's still on time
