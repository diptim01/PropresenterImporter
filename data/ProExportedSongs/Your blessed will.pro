The world is ever changing
but You are still the same
 
If You order my steps
I'll praise Your name
 
Order my steps  in Your word
Order my tongue  in Your word
 
Guide my feet  in Your word
 
Wash my heart  in Your word
Show me how to walk  in Your word
 
Show me how to talk  in Your word
 
When I need a brand new song to sing
Show me how to let Your praises ring
 
In Your word-----
In Your word-----
 
Please order my steps in Your word
Please order my steps in Your word
