Now, I'm a tell the world, tell 'em
I'm a tell it everywhere I go
 
Tell the world, tell 'em
Yeah, I'm a billboard
 
Tell the world, tell 'em
And I'm broadcastin' like a radio
 
Tell the world
You ought to know, I'm brand new
 
I know one thing's true:
I don't even really deserve to know you
 
But, I-I'm a witness that you did this, and I'm brand new
 
So, I-I'm read' to go, and
I'm a tell the world what they need to know
 
A slave to myself, but you let me go, I tried getting high but it left me low
 
You did what they could never do
You cleaned up my soul and
 
Gave me life - I'm so brand new
And that's all that matters
 
I-I ain't love you first but, you first loved me
In my heart I cursed you, but you set me free
 
I gave you no reason to give me new seasons,
to give new life, new breathing
 
But you hung there bleedin', and ya' died for my lies and my cheatin', my lust and my greed and (Lord!)
 
What is a man that you mindful of him?
And what do I have to deserve this lovin'?
 
Tryna make the moments last
Holdin' on to the past
 
But, like a hero in a dream
Christ came, and he rescued me
 
Now, I'm a tell the world, tell 'em
I'm a tell it everywhere I go
 
Tell the world, tell 'em
Yeah, I'm a billboard
 
Tell the world, tell 'em
And I'm broadcastin' like a radio
 
Tell the world
You ought to know, I'm brand new
 
I can't offer you nothin',
but your care & kindness keep comin'
 
And your love is so unconditional,
I get butterflies in my stomach
 
I got the old me in the rearview
Now the new me got a clear view
 
And I was so dead, I couldn't hear you
Too deep in sin to come near you
 
But you drew me in, you cleaned me up,
so take me home, beam me up
 
Before you do, just let me tell the truth, and let these folks know that I done seen ya' love
 
And it's everlasting, infinite, it goes on and on,
you can't measure it
 
Can't quench ya' love, they can't separate us from the love of God, there's no estimate
 
My face look the same, my frame ain't rearranged, but I'm changed; I promise I ain't the same
 
Your love's so deep you suffered and took pain, you died on the cross to give me a new name
 
Ain't nothing like I've seen before, I got a beaming glow
I was low, down, and dirty, but you cleaned me, Lord
 
You adopted me, you keep rocking me
I'm a tell the world, and ain't nobody stopping me!
 
Tryna make the moments last
Holdin' on to the past
 
But, like a hero in a dream
Christ came, and he rescued me
 
Now, I'm a tell the world, tell 'em
I'm a tell it everywhere I go
 
Tell the world, tell 'em
Yeah, I'm a billboard
 
Tell the world, tell 'em
And I'm broadcastin' like a radio
 
Tell the world
You ought to know, I'm brand new
