Come and let us sing
Come and let us sing
 
Come and let us sing
to the King of kings
 
Come and let us shout
Come and let us shout
 
Come and let us shout
To the Lord our God
 
Come and let us dance
Come and let us dance
 
Come and let us dance
Lift up holy hands
 
Enter his gates with thanksgiving
Enter his courts with praise
 
He's worthy
to be praised
 
Exalt His Holy Name
Glory and honor
 
Majesty and power
 
Ha-la-la-la-leluyah...
 
Oooh let us sing...
 
Come and let us Dance
Come and let us Dance
 
Come and let us Clap
Come and let us Clap
 
Come and let us shout!
Come and let us shout!
