You are God
God my God
 
I know we tried to define you
Attempted to describe you
 
It's hard to exemplify your word
Even I call you great
 
And there's nobody greater
But sometimes I just should call upon your name
 
In your name there is safety and security
And whosoever calls on you can be saved
 
Oh God, your name has so much strength
Your name alone is strong
 
You are God
You are God
 
You are God
God my God
 
Heaven and earth shall pass away
But your name will remain
 
And everyone will declare that you are God
 
You are God
You are God
 
Oh oh, Your name alone has strength
Your name alone is strong
 
Oh oh, Your name alone has strength
God my God
 
Your name is a strong tower
(Your name is a strong tower)
 
I run in and I am saved (I run in and I am saved)
 
God my God (God my God)
Your name alone is strong (Your name alone is strong)
 
Your name is a strong tower
(Your name is a strong tower)
 
I run in and I am saved (I run in and I am saved)
 
God my God (God my God)
God my God (God my God)
 
Your name, it saves (God my God)
Your name, it heals (God my God)
 
God my God (God my God)
God my God (God my God
 
I will call on your name (God my God)
I will call on your name (God my God)
 
Your name has power (God my God)
Your name is strong (God my God)
 
Your name is strong (God my God)
Cause you're everything..
