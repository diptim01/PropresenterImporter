He's the same God with the same story
Yesterday beyond today, forever He will still remain
 
The same God with the same story
From glory to glory, we will praise Him
 
I love You Lord and i lift my voice
To worship you O my soul rejoice
 
Take joy my king in what you hear
Let it be a sweet sweet sound in your ear
