I thank you lord
For all you have done
 
And praise your name
 
I thank you lord
For all you have done
 
And praise your name
I'll sing you my song
 
For all you ve done for me
(Done for me)
 
Brought me out of poverty
 
Na who know me before
(no one)
 
Na who like me before
(no one)
 
Na who want me before
(no one)
 
Na who dash me before
Oghene woruno meh ni branama eh, e e e e e e eh
 
I remember my years of pain
Struggle for a living
 
Yet no gain
Sadness and depression
 
Flows in my vein
But like you said in your word
 
I will prevail
Give me garment of praise
 
For my heaviness
Oil of gladness
 
Above my fellow me
 
Na who know me before eh eh
(no one)
 
Na who like me before eh eh
(no one)
 
Na who want me before eh eh
(no one)
 
Na who dash me before eh eh
(no one)
