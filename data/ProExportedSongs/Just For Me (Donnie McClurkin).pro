What does the cross of Jesus mean?
It's more than songs we sing, yeah
 
Much more than that emblem on your chain
But it means I'm free, yes from the chains of slavery
 
And the blood that shed won't let my sins remain,
oh my!
 
Upon the cross my Saviour died,
the Lamb was crucified
 
Showed us love that this world
had never known
 
Oh what love, divine so divine,
true a love you'll never find
 
So that we might live, love came
and died alone, Hallelujah
 
Well the Cross will always represent
the love God had for me
 
When the Lord of glory, Heaven
sent gave all on calvary
 
He did it just for me, just for me, Hallelujah
Jesus came and did it just for me, help me say (2x)
 
Just for me, just for me
Jesus came and did it just for me
 
Just for me, just for me
Jesus came and did it just for me (X3)
