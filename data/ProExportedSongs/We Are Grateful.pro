We are grateful
God we're grateful
 
Yes we are grateful for Your ways
You are faithful
 
To every promise You've made
God we're grateful
 
For Your loving ways
 
When we sing
When we get together
 
When we clap our hands in praise
What we are saying
 
Is that we love You
And God we're grateful
 
For Your loving ways
