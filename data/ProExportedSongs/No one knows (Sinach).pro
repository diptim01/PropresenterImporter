No one knows (Sinach)
 
From the rising of the sun
Till it’s going down
 
Your Faithfulness is sure
Your mercies ever new
 
(4x)
 
No one knows
Like I know
 
What You’ve done for me
That’s why I praise You the way I do
 
(4x)
 
Your favor surrounds me,
like a shield
 
Your Love amazes me
Your Grace has lifted me
 
(4x)
 
Chorus (4x)
 
Interlude
 
I sing
 
I dance
I shout for joy
 
Lord I’m grateful
(4x)
