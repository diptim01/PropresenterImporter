Ewa bami gbe igba ope oo
(Come let's praise together)
 
Ye ye ye
(in celebration)
 
Emi leni t'aye to ro
(The world has thought of me)
 
Wipe ko le da nkan 're se
(That i cant do something good)
 
Sugbon mo ri anu re gba
(But i received HIS mercy)
 
Olu orun lo bami se
(The King of heaven has helped me)
