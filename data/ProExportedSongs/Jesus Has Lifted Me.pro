Out of the depths to the glory above,
I have been lifted in wonderful love,
 
From ev'ry fetter my Spirit is free,
For Jesus has lifted me!
 
Out of the world into heavenly rest,
Into the land of the ransomed and blest,
 
There in the glory with Him I shall be,
For Jesus has lifted me!
 
Out of myself into Him I adore,
There to abide in His love evermore,
 
Through endless ages His glory to see,
My Jesus has lifted me!
 
Jesus lifted me! Jesus lifted me!
Out of the night into glorious light,
 
Yes, Jesus has lifted me!
