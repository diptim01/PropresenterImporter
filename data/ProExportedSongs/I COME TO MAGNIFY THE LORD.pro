I CAME TO MAGNIFY THE LORD I CAME TO PRAISE
HIS HOLY NAME I CAME
 
TO LIFT JESUS HIGHER (2X)
 
FOR HE IS WORTHY,
WORTHY OF MY PRAISE...
 
NEVER WILL A ROCK CRY OUT IN MY PLACE HE'S WORTHY OF ALL MY PRAISE (2X)
 
I JUST CAME TO MAGNIFY
I JUST CAME TO GLORIFY
 
I JUST CAME TO PRAISE
THE LORD
 
I JUST CAME TO MAGNIFY
I JUST CAME TO GLORIFY
 
I JUST CAME TO PRAISE
THE LORD
