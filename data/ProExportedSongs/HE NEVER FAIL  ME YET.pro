THIS IS MY STORY
THIS IS MY SONG
 
I'LL BE PRAISING  MY SAVIOUR ALL THE DAY LONG
I'LL NEVER WORRY,I'LL NEVER FRET
 
BECAUSE HE, HE NEVER FAIL ME YET
 
I'LL BE PRAISING ALL THE DAY LONG
LIFT YOUR VOICE AND SAY NOW OH OH OH
 
HOW LONG MUST YOU
CARRY THOSES TROUBLES ON
 
HE NEVER FAIL ME YET
HE NEVER FAIL
 
HE NEVER FAIL ME YET.
 
HE NEVER FAIL ME YET
 
THIS IS MY STORY
