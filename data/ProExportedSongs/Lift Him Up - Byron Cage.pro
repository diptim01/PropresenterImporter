No matter what the problem may be
He's in control and He knows everything
 
I have the victory for He is my King
in Him I live, move, and I have my being
 
Let the people lift Him up,
rejoice, and shout unto Him.
 
For You have caused us to triumph
and we know we will rule in the end
 
Lift Him up, lift Him up,
lift Him up higher and higher (X4)
 
Higher, higher, higher,
higher and higher (x2)
 
Lift Him up, lift Him up,
lift Him up higher and higher....
