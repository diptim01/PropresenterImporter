All of the heavens sing
All of the heavens sing
 
Sing of the thing You do
Sing of the thing You do
 
Song of Your faithfulness
And proclaim that there's no One like You
 
All of the nations sing
sing of Your mighty power
 
In You we put our trust
we proclaim Your our strength and our shield
 
I will sing of the Lord's great love for ever more
With my mouth I will shout for joy for ever more
 
Ime Imela, Imela, Imela
