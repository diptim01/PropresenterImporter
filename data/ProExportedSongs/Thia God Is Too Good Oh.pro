Verse 1:
 
I know a God, who’s merciful and kind
Faithful and gracious
 
I’m the apple of his eyes
And the thought that fills his heart
 
Every Morning, noon and night
He loved me when I didn’t care
 
And was patient till I came
Running back into his arms
 
Look how he turned my life around
Making me a shining star
 
His glory to reveal
 
I will worship him forever
Love him forever because
 
This God is too good o
 
I will worship him forever
 
Love him forever because
This God is too good o
 
Don’t look too far to see how good he is
Just look at me
 
He took me from the miry clay
Set my foot upon the rock
 
I’m standing in his righteousness
He took away my sin and shame
 
Gave me a brand new name
His beloved and the redeemed
 
Look how he turned my life around
Made me a shinning light, his glory to reveal
 
This God is too good o
 
This God is too kind o
 
This God is awesome o
 
This God is too much  o
