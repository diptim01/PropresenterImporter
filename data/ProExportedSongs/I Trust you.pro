Even though I can't see
And I can't feel your touch
 
I will trust you lord
How I love you so much
 
Though my nights my seem long
And I feel so alone
 
Lord my trust is in you
I surrender to you
 
So many painful thoughts
Travel through my mind
 
And I wonder how
I will make it through this time
 
But I trust you
Lord it's not easy
 
Sometimes the pain in my life
Makes you seem far away
 
But I'll trust you
I need to know you're here
 
Through the tears and the pain
Through the heartache and rain
 
I'll trust you
 
Everything that I see
Tells me not to believe
 
But I'll trust you lord
You have never failed me
 
My past still controls me
Will this hurt ever leave?
 
I can only trust you
No one else like you do
 
I can
I will
 
I must
Trust you
 
I will
Trust you
 
I'll trust you [x3]
I will
 
God will make a way [x4]
