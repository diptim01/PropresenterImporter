It's a new season, it's a new day.
A fresh anointing is flowing my way.
 
T's a season of power and prosperity.
It's a new season coming to me.
 
The devil's time is up no longer can he bother me,
Ã«cause the Creator of the universe He fathers me,
 
and it's transferable my children's children shall be free;
it's a new season (it's a new season
 
,Tried in the fire but you're coming out gold.
 
It's a new season coming to me.
