WHEN I TAKE MY BATH
I THINK ABOUT THE LORD
 
AND HOW HE WASHED AWAY MY SIN
LET ME TELL YOU MORE
 
HE WASHED MY HANS SO I CAN TOUCH
THE WORLD HE LOVES SO VERY MUCH
 
JESUS FILLS ME UP WITH HOPE
AND WASHES ME WITH SUPER SOAP
 
HE WASHED MY FEET SO I COULD WALK
AND HEAR THE HAPPY GOSPEL TALK
 
JESUS FILLS ME UP WITH HOPE
AND WASHES ME WITH SUPER SOAP
 
HE WASHED MY FACE SO I COULD SMILE
AND TELL THE WORLD I AM HIS CHILD
 
JESUS FILLS ME UP WITH HOPE
AND WASHES ME WITH SUPER SOAP
