From the rising of the sun
To the setting of the same
 
let the name of
the Lord be praised
 
And until my dying day
When there is no more
 
i can say
Let the name of the Lord be praised
 
Praise He the lord
Praise God in the sanctuary
 
Praise Him in the firmament of his power
oh oh
 
Praise He the lord
Praise God in the sanctuary
 
Praise Him(2x)
Praise He the Lord
 
God be praised(4x)
Let the name of the Lord
 
be praised
oh oh oh
