ooo, how sweet the name Jesus
 
How sweet the name of Jesus sounds,
In a believer's ear;
 
It soothes His sorrows, heals His wounds
And drives away His fear.
 
It makes the wounded Spirit whole
And calms the troubled breast;
 
'Tis manna to the hungry soul
And to the weary, rest.
 
Dear name! the Rock on which I build,
My shield and hiding place;
 
My never failing treasure,
Filled with boundless stores of grace.
 
Jesus, my Saviour, Brother, Friend,
My Prophet, Priest, and King
 
My Lord, my Life, my Way, my End,
Accept the praise I bring.
 
Weak is the effort of my heart
And cold my warmest thought;
 
But when I see Thee as Thou art,
I'll praise Thee as I ought.
 
Till then I would Thy love proclaim
With ev'ry fleeting breath;
 
And may the music of Thy name
Refresh my soul in death.
