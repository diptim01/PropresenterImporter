As I lay me down
Heaven hear me now
 
I'm lost without a cause
After giving it my all
 
Winter storms have come
And darkened my sun
 
After all that I've been through
Who on earth can I turn to?
 
I look to you
I look to you
 
After all my strength is gone
In you I can be strong
 
The rain is falling,defeat is calling
I need you to set me free
 
Take me far away from the battle
I need you,shine on me
 
I look to you
I look to you
 
After all my strength is gone
In you I can be strong
 
I look to you
I look to you
 
And when melodies are gone
In you I hear a song, I look to you
 
I look to you
I look to you
