Your Grace is changing my life
In so many ways
 
When I thought my life was over
You were waiting there for me
 
Now I can see
That there are good things
 
Only suffering can bring
 
Your Grace is changing my life
In so many ways
 
I'm looking forward to the future
The work I have to do
 
Knowing I'm forgiven
And acceptable to You
 
Thank You for Your healing Grace
 
Oh Lord Holy Lord
Who took my despair
 
And put joy in its place
Oh Lord most Holy Lord
 
Thank you for Your healing Grace
