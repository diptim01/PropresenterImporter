Lord I lift a song of worship
For YOUR glory
 
and YOUR  grace
Let my Heart reveal all my words fail to say
 
LORD receive this
sacrifice of praise (3x)
 
On the mountain in the valley
As wait in the secret place
 
I will trust in the
name of the LORD
 
Now receive this
sacrifice of praise
 
Now receive this
sacrifice of praise (3x)
 
YOU are my sheild YOU are my shelter
From the storm
 
and from the rain
Cover me beneath the
 
shadow of your wings
LORD receive this
 
sacrifice of praise (3x)
 
Halleluyah Halleluyah Halleluyah To YOUR name
for all YOU've done
 
YOU are and forever will be
LORD receive this
 
sacrifice of praise (3x)
