Safely through another week
God has brought us on our way;
 
Let us now a blessing seek,
Waiting in His courts today.
 
Day of all the week the best,
Emblem of eternal rest!
 
Day of all the week the best,
Emblem of eternal rest!
 
While we pray for pard'ning grace,
Thro' the dear Redeemer's name,
 
Show Thy reconciled face,
Take away our sin and shame.
 
From our worldly cares set free,
May we rest this day in Thee;
 
From our worldly cares set free,
May we rest this day in Thee.
 
Here we come Thy name to praise;
May we feel Thy presence near.
 
May Thy glory meet our eyes,
While we in Thy house appear.
 
Here afford us, Lord, a taste,
Of our everlasting feast;
 
Here afford us, Lord, a taste
Of our everlasting feast.
 
May Thy Gospel's joyful sound,
Conquer sinners, comfort saints,
 
Make the fruits of grace abound,
Bring relief for all complaints.
 
Thus may all our Sabbaths prove,
Till we join the Church above;
 
Thus may all our Sabbaths prove,
Will we join the Church above.
