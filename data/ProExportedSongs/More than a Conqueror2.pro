I'm not just a conqueror
No not just a conqueror
 
I'm not just a conqueror
But I'm more than a conqueror X2
 
The fight is fixed
I know, I'll win
 
I won't give in
Cause I'm more than a conqueror
 
I can't, can't go wrong
Cause I'm more than a conqueror
 
I am not a conqueror
Don't call me a conqueror
 
I am not a conqueror
Cause I'm more than a conqueror X2
 
The fight is fixed
I know, I'll win
 
I won't give in
Cause I'm more than a conqueror
 
My walk is strong
My faith is long
 
I can't, can't go wrong
Cause I'm more than a conqueror
 
More, More, More, Iâ€”am----More,
I am more than a conqueror x5
