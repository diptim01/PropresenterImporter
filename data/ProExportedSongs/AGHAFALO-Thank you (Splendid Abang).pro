AGHAFALO-Thank you Lyrics (by Splendid Abang)
 
Yahweh …. Elyon
 
Beginning and the end… Who was and is to come
 
Father… Savior
 
You know my very end… And when it all began
 
For the rest of our days… We will proclaim
 
Your Holy name… In all the earth
 
O.....O... O.... O.... O
 
Aghafalo eh (x2)
(Thank You)
 
Ogenab eh (x2)
(You are too good)
 
Imela oh (4×)..Oghene doh (4×)
(Thank you Lord)
 
Adupe oh (4×)
(Thank you Lord)
