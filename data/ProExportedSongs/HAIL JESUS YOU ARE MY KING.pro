Hail Jesus! You're my King!
Your life frees me to sing
 
I will praise You all my days
You're perfect in all Your ways
 
Hail Jesus! You're my Lord!
I will obey Your word
 
I want to see
Your kingdom come
 
Not my will but Yours be done
 
Glory, glory to the Lamb!
You will take me into the land
 
We will conquer in Your name
And proclaim that """"Jesus reigns!""""
 
Hail, hail Lion of Judah!
How wonderful You are!
 
Hail, hail Lion of Judah!
How powerful You are!
 
Hail, hail Lion of Judah!
How wonderful You are!
 
Hail, hail Lion of Judah!
How powerful You are!
