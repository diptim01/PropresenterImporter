WHEN I LOOK INTO
YOUR HOLINESS
 
WHEN I GAZE INTO
YOUR LOVELINESS
 
WHEN ALL THINGS THAT SURROUND ME
BECOME SHADOWS IN THE LIGHT OF YOU
 
WHEN I'VE FOUND
THE JOY OF REACHING YOUR HEART
 
WHEN MY WILL BECOMES
ENTHRALLED IN YOUR LOVE,
 
WHEN ALL THINGS THAT SURROUND ME BECOME
 
SHADOWS IN THE LIGHT
OF YOU
 
I WORSHIP YOU (2X)
 
We worship You
 
THE REASON I LIVE
IS TO WORSHIP YOU (2X)
 
THE REASON I LIVE
IS TO WORSHIP YOU
 
YOU...
