Because of love we got a family
Because of life we've got a legacy
 
Because of hope we've got a destiny
Because of God there's a plan for you and me
 
What's changin around here
What's changin around here
 
What's changin around here
I say lives are changin
 
We were hungry you gave us food to eat
We were blinded you gave us light to see
 
We were defeated you gave us victory
We started singing you gave us harmony
 
What's changin around here
What's changin around here
 
What's changin around here
I say lives are changin
 
Lives are changin
Lives are changin
 
Lives are changin
Lives are changin
 
My life's changin
My life's changin
 
My life's changin
Lives are changin
 
My life's changin
My life's changin
 
My life's changin
My life's changin

Devoted to prayer devoted to service
Lives are changin
 
United in thought united in purpose
Oh, oh, oh, oh
 
Lives are changin
