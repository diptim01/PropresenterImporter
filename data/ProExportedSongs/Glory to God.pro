We shout it out loud for our God who is able
We shout it out loud for our God who is able
 
Blessings and glory and honour
Dominion and power be unto our God
 
Glory to God, Glory to God
In the highest, In the highest
Glory to God
 
Clap your hands and praise the Lord
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Shout Hallelujah
