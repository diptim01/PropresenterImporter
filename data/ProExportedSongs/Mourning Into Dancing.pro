Your Light Broke
Through My Night
 
Restored Exceeding Joy
Your Grace Fell Like The Rain
 
And Made This Desert Live
 
Your Hand Lifted Me Up
I Stand On Higher Ground
 
Your Praise Rose In My Heart
And Made This Valley Sing
 
THIS IS HOW WE OVERCOME!
 
YOU have  Turned
My Mourning Into Dancing
 
You Have Turned
My Sorrow Into Joy
