There is no Condemnation
For those In Christ Jesus
 
By His blood
I have been made free
 
There is no
Condemnation,
 
For those
In Christ Jesus
 
By His blood
I have been redeemed
 
Because of His forgiveness
I don始t have to live with shame anymore
 
Because of His Redemption
No more condemnation
 
There始s no more
 
Christ who died Raised to life
 
Made a way for me
 
There始s no depth
There始s no height
 
That can separate me
 
From his love...
