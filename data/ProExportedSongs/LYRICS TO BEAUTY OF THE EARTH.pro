Just as I am
You called me to your throne
 
And in humble adoration
I bow to worship you
 
You are the beauty of the earth
The pride of the heavens lord
 
You are...the great I am
So big you fill the earth
 
And you live inside of me
Oh Lord.....My God
 
I live to worship you
 
You told me that you love me so.....
you counted none of my sins
 
But you loved me as I was
As I was......
