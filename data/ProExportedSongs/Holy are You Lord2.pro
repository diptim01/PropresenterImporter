Can you hear the sound of heaven
Like the sound of many waters
 
It's the sound of worship coming from the throne
 
There are cries of adoration
As men from every nation
 
Lift their voice to make His glory known,singing
 
Holy, Holy, are you Lord
Holy Holy are you Lord
 
The Elders and Angels bow
The redeemed worship you now
 
Holy Holy are you Lord
