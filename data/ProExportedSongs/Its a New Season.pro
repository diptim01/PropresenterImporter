In a world where there is
seasons and times
 
This is your season
Its time to shine again
 
its time to shine again
 
Your latter day will be greater
than the rest
 
Your latter day will be greater
than the past
 
You will be blessed more
than you could ask
 
Inspite of all that has been done
The best is yet to come
 
Your latter will be greater
than the rest
 
All things are possible
 
In a world where there
is seasons and times
 
This is your season
Its time to shine again
 
its time to shine again
 
I believe this is my season
Its time to shine again
 
SHINE AGAIN
