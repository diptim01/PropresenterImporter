As You did it then for Moses
Waters part for me right now
 
You will never let me down
You're my Covenant Lord
 
As You did it then for David
Giants fall for me right now
 
You will never let me down
You're my Covenant Lord
 
You're my Covenant Lord X4
 
As You did it then for Abraham
Blessings follow me right now
 
You will never let me down
Nooo, Covenant Lord
 
As You did it then for Esther
Kings will favour me right now
 
Oh You will never let me down
You're my Covenant Lord
 
Oh oh oh Jesus, You keep all Your promises
 
Oh oh oh oh Jesus, You're my only Covenant Lord
X2
 
You're my Covenant Lord X4
 
Covenant Keeper X4
