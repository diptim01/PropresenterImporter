You have the power
To make the seasons change
 
The river flows for you 
The wind whispers Your name
 
For me You left Your throne 
And traded crown for thorns instead
 
I'm safe within not by Your skin 
But because Your blood was red
 
Some say You're black, You're white
They question if You're real
 
We treat You like we treat ourselves
I wonder how You feel
 
To see your children fight inspite
of the tears for us you've shed
 
Doesn't matter what color you are 
As long as your blood was red
 
We may be different but
The God we serve's the same
 
Yet every Sunday we separate
And bring the Father pain
 
Your name is higher than any other
Yet You took my place instead
 
And now my sins are washed away
Because Your blood was red
 
OH PRECIIOUS IS THE FLOW
THAT MAKES ME WHITE AS  SNOW
 
NO OTHER FOUNT I KNOW
 
It doesn't matter what color you are
As long as your blood was red
 
For it's strong enough
to wash away my sins
 
And it's pure enough
To cleanse me deep within
 
And it's real enough
To find me when I'm lost
 
Great enough
To die upon the cross
 
It doesn't matter what color you are
As long as your blood was red
