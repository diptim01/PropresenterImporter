Angels from the realms of glory,
Wing your flight o'er all the earth;
 
Ye who sang creation's story,
Now proclaim Messiah's birth.
 
Come and worship, come and worship;
Worship Christ, the newborn King!
 
Shepherds in the fields abiding,
Watching o'er your flocks by night;
 
God with man is now residing,
Yonder shines the infant Light.
 
Come and worship, come and worship;
Worship Christ, the newborn King!
 
Sages, leave your contemplations,
Brighter visions beam afar;
 
Seek the great Desire of nations,
Ye have seen His natal star.
 
Come and worship, come and worship;
Worship Christ, the newborn King!
 
Saints, before the altar bending,
Watching long in hope and fear;
 
Suddenly the Lord, descending,
In His temple shall appear.
 
Come and worship, come and worship;
Worship Christ, the newborn King!
 
All creation, join in praising,
God, the Father, Spirit, Son;
 
Evermore your voices raising,
To the eternal Three in One.
 
Come and worship, come and worship;
Worship Christ, the newborn King!
 
Angels We Have Heard on High
 
Angels we have heard on high,
Sweetly singing o'er the plains;
 
And the mountains in reply,
Echoing their joyous strains.
 
Shepherds, why this jubilee?
Why your joyous strains prolong?
 
Say what may the tidings be;
Which inspire your heav'nly song?
 
Come to Bethlehem and see,
Him whose birth the angels sing;
 
Come adore on bended knee,
Christ the Lord, the newborn King.
 
See within a manger laid,
Jesus, Lord of heav'n and earth;
 
Mary, Joseph, lend your aid,
With us sing our Savior's birth.
 
Gloria, in excelsis Deo!

Come, adore on bended knee,
