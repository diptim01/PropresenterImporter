TIME AFTER TIME
I HEAR PEOPLE SAY TO ME
 
WHY DON'T WE SEE MIRACLES AS THERE
ONCE USED TO BE?
 
I STILL BELEIVE IN MIRACLES
GOD HEARS ME WHEN I PRAY
 
GOD WAS GOD THEN
AND HE STILL IS TODAY
 
GOD CAN DO IT AGAIN
AND AGAIN AND AGAIN
 
HE IS THE SAME GOD TODAY
AS HE ALWAYS HAS BEEN
 
YESTERDAY AND TODAY
AND FOREVER THE SAME
 
THERE IS NO REASON TO DOUBT
GOD WILL DO IT AGAIN
 
THERE IS NO REASON TO DOUBT
GOD WILL DO IT AGAIN...
