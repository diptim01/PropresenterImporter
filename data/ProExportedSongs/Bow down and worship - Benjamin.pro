Bow down and worship Him x2
Worship Him, oh worship Him (Repeat)
 
Jesus the King of kings x2
Worship Him, oh worship Him (Repeat)
 
Consuming fire, sweet perfume
His awesome presence fills this place
 
For this is Holy ground
So come lets bow down (Repeat)
 
Bow down and worship Him x2
Worship Him, oh worship Him (Repeat)
