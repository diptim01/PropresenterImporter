O Jesus, I have promised
To serve Thee to the end;
 
Be Thou forever near me,
My Master and my Friend;
 
I shall not fear the battle
If Thou art by my side,
 
Nor wander from the pathway
If Thou wilt be my Guide.
 
Oh, let me feel Thee near me;
The world is ever near;
 
I see the sights that dazzle,
The tempting sounds I hear;
 
My foes are ever near me,
Around me and within;
 
But, Jesus, draw Thou nearer,
And shield my soul from sin.
 
Oh, let me hear Thee speaking,
In accents clear and still,
 
Above the storms of passion,
The murmurs of self-will;
 
Oh, speak to reassure me,
To hasten, or control;
 
Oh, speak, and make me listen,
Thou Guardian of my soul.
 
O Jesus, Thou hast promised
To all who follow Thee
 
That where Thou art in glory
There shall Thy servant be;
 
And Jesus, I have promised
To serve Thee to the end;
 
Oh, give me grace to follow,
My Master and my Friend.
