I'm only human.
I'm just a young girl.
 
Lord help me believe in all I can be
And all that I am.
 
Show me the stairway that I have to climb
And Lord for my sake
 
Teach me to take one day at a time.
 
One day at a time sweet Jesus
That's all that I'm asking from You.
 
Lord give me the strength
to do every day what I have to do.
 
Yesterday's gone sweet Jesus
and tomorrow may never be mine.
 
Lord help me today show me
the way one day at a time.
 
Now do You remember
when You walked among men?
 
Well Jesus You know if You're looking below
 
It's worse now than then.
Cheating and stealing violence and crime
 
And so for my sake teach
me to take one day at a time.
 
One day at a time sweet Jesus
That's all that I'm asking from You.
 
Lord give me the strength
to do every day what I have to do.
 
Yesterday's gone sweet Jesus
and tomorrow may never be mine.
 
Lord help me today and
show me the way one day at a time.
 
Lord help me today show me the way
One day at a time.
