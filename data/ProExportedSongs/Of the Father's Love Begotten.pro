Of the Father's love begotten,
Ere the world began to be;
 
He is Alpha and Omega,
He the source, the ending He.
 
Of the things that are that have been
And that future years shall see;
 
Evermore and evermore!
 
O, ye heights of heaven adore Him,
Angel hosts; His praises sing;
 
Pow'rs, dominions, bow before Him
And extol our God and King;
 
Let no tongue on earth be silent,
Ev'ry voice in concert ring;
 
Evermore and evermore!
 
Christ, to Thee with God the Father,
And, O Holy Ghost, to Thee;
 
Hymn and chant and high thanksgiving
And unwearied praises be:
 
Honor, glory, and dominion and eternal victory;
Evermore and evermore!
 
Amen.
