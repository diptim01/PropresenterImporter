Feel the move, a seismic groove.
That’s the power of love unending.
 
Feel the force. We know the source.
God is everywhere, Lord of everything.
 
One love, that is perfect, that is holy, (1-2-3)
 
It’s Oh- oh-oh-oh-oh -oh
Unstoppable! Unstoppable!
 
Oh- oh-oh-oh-oh -oh
Unstoppable! Unstoppable!
 
Feel the ways, in every day,
God is here, watching over us.
 
Feel the call. Come one, come all.
We must go, share the love we know.
 
One love, that is perfect, that is holy, (1-2-3)
 
It’s Oh- oh-oh-oh-oh -oh
