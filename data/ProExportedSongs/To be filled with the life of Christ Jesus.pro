*To be filled with the life of Christ Jesus
And then released into our destinies
Taking the world for Him*
 
Our Mission : Changed Lives
 
Through God We Did It
We Did It
 
That's right We Did It
Yeah We Did It
 
We Did It
Rejoice We Did It
 
Said We Did It
We Did It
 
That's right We Did It
Yeah We Did It
 
We Did It
Rejoice We Did It
 
2016 is gone
That's right We Did It
 
And a new year is come
Rejoice We Did It
 
God has kept us strong
Through God We Did It
 
Now here's a new song
Rejoice We Did It
 
Through God We Did It, we live it
Believed we could achieve it
 
So wrecked the devil's Kingdom as we deemed it fitting
Stepped out to win souls so the devil is underneath
 
The soles of our feet acts as his binding sheath
The peace of the master made me a masterpiece
 
Better shot that Deadshot so I'll never miss
Sin accuses us with its fallacies
 
Vindicated by Christ so case dismissed
 
5 years in a row
God's Favorite House stepped out to the floor
 
The Spirit of the Lord is doubled in us
To free prisoners that are bound up
 
With admonition
We preach
 
Good tidings to those that are meek
We have now been named the Lord's Priests
 
Being released into our destinies
Rejoice We Did it
 
Now here's Gfh got me feeling like a rapper
God the Son says I'm a star no lager
 
The Spirit has me in tongues, shey-ka-raba
All the praise goes back to God, that's my Father
 
Got the new year that's near on my mind
That's 2000 + 17 years combined
 
True Worshippers' worship flows like the Nile
And the pastors got God on speed dial
 
It's Jesus Christ that we all serve
This church has got the Holy Spirit
running through our nerves
 
Ever wonder why Jesus Christ our best friend?
It's cause He favors this church to the very end
 
Whatever the world might say to us we don't send
Cause we made up our minds to follow just the blessed trend
 
It don't matter how many demons Satan sends
Cause in the end heaven and hell just don't blend
 
5 years in a row

Being released into our destinies
Rejoice We Did it
 
Heaven opens up in a vision
To get into that golden gate is my mission
 
You'll never lack cause all your needs heaven sent
Free of charge, no bills, fines or rent
 
It's never too late to get into His Estate
Going through those gates should be our one and only fate
 
Never take bad bait, never try to contemplate
Cause for sure no other loves' got a higher rate
 
Now spread our wings fly cause He takes us to the top
He takes us so high like we're never gonna drop
 
Born the King of kings, His reign would never stop
So in praise we sing, Jehovah's all we got
 
Just as my Bible says, my God, He is able
To do more than I ever dreamed of, keep me stable
 
You're never gonna find one as reliable
Believe that, it's undeniable
 
Yeah!
