We come into His presence with singing
Come into Your Presence with Praise
 
Enter Your gates with thankful hearts
We are going to celebrate
 
All of heavens waiting
Power is on its way
 
So we shout HALLELUYAH
lifting to You
 
A mighty roar of praise
 
You deserve the highest praise….
 
You deserve the highest praise
We can give and more
 
So we give You the praise
 
That's what we came here for…
 
Everything within me
Reaches out to You
 
Your power…Your Majesty
Grace and Mercy too
 
There'll be singing and dancing
Hearts and voices raised
 
You have set Your people free
Now the house is filled with praise
 
You deserve the highest praise….
