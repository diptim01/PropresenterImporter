Lord You've searched me and You know me
You know when I sit and when I rise
 
You know my thoughts from far away
There's nothing hidden from Your eyes
 
Before I was born You saw me
Your love wrote the pages of my destiny
 
Sing over me with joy
May my life bring You pleasure
 
I'll show my love for You
Through the gifts You've given me
 
Lord You are my treasure
My life does not belong to me
 
Your love paid the difference
Changed my destiny
 
In everything I do
I can worship you
 
I was created to
These hands that you have made
 
Are instruments of praise
My life will worship you
 
These hands that you have made
Are instruments of praise
 
I will worship you
With my life I will worship you
