You came into my heart,
You changed my world,
 
You came into my soul, You changed my whole life,
Right from the start You knew my name,
 
Before I was born, You took away every shame
 
I worship You, You, You
 
I worship You, I worship You
(X2)
 
You came into my heart, Father You made me Your glory,
You came into my soul, You changed my whole story,
 
Right from the start Lord You knew my name,
Before I was born You took away every shame

You came into my heart,
 
You made me your glory Lord,
You came into my soul,
 
You changed all my story,
You knew my name, before I was born you took away every shame
