SATAN LOSE
 
In Matthew chapter two
satan loose
 
When Jesus was
born in a manger
 
And in the wilderness
satan loose again
 
At the Mount of Transfiguration
Yeah!
 
At the crucifixion
satan loose again
 
When Jesus rose triumphantly
From the grave
 
And at the ascension
satan loose
 
Once more
When I was born again
 
Yeah!
