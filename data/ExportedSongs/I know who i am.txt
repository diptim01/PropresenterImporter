We are a chosen generation
Called forth to show His excellence
 
All I require for life; God has given me
And I know who I am
 
I know who God says I am; What He says I am
Where He says am at; I know who I am
 
I’m working in power, I’m working miracles
I live a life of favor, Cause I know who I am
 
Ohh oh oh, oh oh oh
I know who I am
 
I am holy, I am righteous oh…
I am so rich, I am beautiful
 
I’m working in power, I’m working miracles
I live a life of favor, Cause I know who I am
 
Take a look at me, I’m a wonder
It doesn’t matter what you see now
 
Can you see His glory, ‘Cause I know who I am
 
Ohh oh oh, oh oh oh
I know who I am
