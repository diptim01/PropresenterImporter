Creation shows the power of God
There's glory all around and
 
those who see must stand in awe,
For miracles abound.
 
I cannot doubt the work of God,
It's plain for all to see:
 
The miracles that he has wrought
Should lead to Calvary.
 
The love of God! O power divine!
'Tis wonderful to see
 
The miracle of grace performed
With-in the heart of me.
 
I believe in miracles
I've seen a soul set free
 
Miraculous the change in one
redeemed through Calvary;
 
I've seen the lily push its way
up through the stubborn sod
 
I believe in miracles for
I believe in God!
