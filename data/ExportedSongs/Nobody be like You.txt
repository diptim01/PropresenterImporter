I will lift up my hands to You
 
I will lift up my voice to You
 
And sing a victory song to You
 
Great and Mighty is who You are
 
Nobody like You, Nobody like You
 
Alpha, nobody like You
 
Omega, nobody like You
 
Ko se ni bi re (2x)
(Nobody like You)
 
Oluwa ko se ni bi reâ€¦. Oluwa ko se ni bi re
(My God, there is no one like You)
