Father, I said till*
Death do us part
I want to mean it
 
With all of my heart
Help me to love you
More than I love her
 
Then I know I can
Love her more
Than anyone else
 
And bring her in
Your presence today
 
Make her what
You want her to be
 
I pray to hear her heart
I pray she'll love you more
 
I pray to cherish and serve her
And we'll bring you glory today, I pray
 
I pray to cherish and serve her
And we'll bring you glory today, I pray
 
Father, I said till
Death do us part
 
I want to mean it
With all of my heart
 
Help me to love you
More than I love him
Then I know I can
 
Love him more
Than anyone else
 
And bring him in
Your presence today
 
Lord, help me love her
As you love the church, your bride
 
(Josee) Help me submit to him
As I submit to you, my life
