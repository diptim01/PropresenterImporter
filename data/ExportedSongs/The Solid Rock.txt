My hope is built on nothing less
 
Than Jesus' Blood and righteousness.
 
I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
 
But wholly lean on Jesus' Name.
 
When darkness seems to hide His face,
 
I rest on His unchanging grace.
 
In every high and stormy gale,
 
My anchor holds within the veil.
 
His Oath, His Covenant, His Blood,
 
Support me in the whelming flood.
 
When all around my soul gives way,
 
He then is all my Hope and Stay.
 
When He shall come with trumpet sound,
 
O may I then in Him be found!
 
Dressed in His Righteousness alone,
 
Faultless to stand before The Throne!
 
On Christ the Solid Rock I stand,
 
All other ground is sinking sand.
 
All other ground is sinking sand.
