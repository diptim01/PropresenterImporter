Ding dong!î merrily on high
In Heav'n the bells are ringing:
 
ìDing dong!î verily the sky
Is riv'n with Angel singing.
 
E'en so here below, below,
Let steeple bells be swungen,
 
And "io, io, io!"
By priest and people sungen.
 
Pray you, dutifully prime
Your matin chime, ye ringers;
 
May you beautifully rhyme
Your eve-time song, ye singers.
 
Glo-o-o-o-o-o-ria,
Hosanna in excelsis!
 
Glo-o-o-o-o-o-ria
Hosanna in excelsis!
