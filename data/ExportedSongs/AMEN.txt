I asked myself how did HE do it?
Make such a sacrifice
 
And the ones that HE loved
wanted HIM crucified.
(Oh yeah)
 
And HE knew that HIS friends would betray HIM
And HE knew that HIS blood would be shed
 
HE could have found someone else in HIS place
But instead HE said
 
Amen ...
 
So I looked at my tests and trials
They can't compare to HIS pain
 
And if HE can go through it
Surely I can do the same
Oh LORD
 
I bless YOU for all of the bad
And I bless YOU for all of the good
 
And the place where I stand
YOU have already stood
 
Amen!
Mmm I surrender
 
Amen!
And my will be YOURS
 
Amen!
I lift my hands and say
 
Amen!
 
Amen!
Never the less Amen
 
Amen!
I don't understand but Amen
 
Amen!
LORD I surrender
 
Amen!
 
My soul say Amen
Amen!
 
This is not about me Lord
Amen!
 
Oohh I've got YOUR will
Amen!
 
Amen! Amen! Amen!
Amen! Amen! Amen!
 
of this present time are not worthy
to be compared with the glory
 
which shall be revealed in us.
