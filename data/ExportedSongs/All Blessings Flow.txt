There is a melody… That I love to sing
 
It's in a simple song of praise… To my Savior and my King
 
The name that calms my fears… And bids my sorrow cease
 
Is music to my ears… It is life and health and peace
 
Praise God from whom all blessings flow..
 
Praise Him all creatures here below
 
Praise him above the heavenly host
 
Praise Father, Son and Holy Ghost
 
All blessings flow… From the Father
 
All blessings flow… From the Son
 
All blessings Flow… From the Spirit
 
Praise Him… Praise Him
