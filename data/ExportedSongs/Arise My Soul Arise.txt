Arise, my soul arise.
Shake off thy guilty fears.
 
The bleeding Sacrifice
In my behalf appears.
 
Before the throne my Surety stands,
Before the throne my Surely stands;
 
My name is written on His hands.
 
He ever lives above,
For me to intercede,
 
His all redeeming love,
His precious blood to plead.
 
His blood atoned for all our race,
His blood atoned for all our race,
 
And sprinkles now the throne of grace.
 
Five bleeding wounds He bears,
Received on Calvary.
 
They pour effectual prayers,
They strongly plead for me.
 
"Forgive Him, oh, forgive," they cry.
"Forgive Him, oh, forgive," they cry,
 
"Nor let that ransomed sinner die."
 
The Father hears Him pray,
His dear Anointed One;
 
He cannot turn away
The presence of His Son.
 
His Spirit answers to the Blood,
His Spirit answers to the Blood,
 
And tells me I am born of God.
 
My God is reconciled,
His pard'ning voice I hear.
 
He owns me for His child;
I can no longer fear.
 
With confidence I now draw nigh,
With confidence I now draw nigh,
 
And, "Father, Abba, Father," cry.
 
Arise... awaken from your sleep
 
Arise... awaken from your sleep
The earth... calls in out in desperate need
 
Arise, arise, arise... your light has come
(And the glory of the Lord is upon you)
 
You were created for this time
So arise, the spirit says arise
 
Arise... this is your destiny
Endow... Christ's authority
 
Decree, declare and speak in Jesus' name
(And every principality)
 
Was bowed down
You were created for this time
 
So arise, the spirit says arise
 
The Church we see is not
the periphery of the world
 
But the world on the periphery of the church
 
Meaning that when God looks at the earth,
When He looks at a city,
 
He does not see a city with a church in it;
He sees the church with a city around it.
 
The Church is the vehicle by which Jesus
Speaks, asks and moves;
 
Everything God wants to do in the earth,
He wants to do through His Church.
 
Now that you hear his calling and awakening,
What will be your response?
 
Will you sit back, or will you arise?
Will you stay asleep, or will you take a stand?
 
I believe that when the Lord speaks,
He waits for His people
 
To release a sound of response
This is our response:
 
We will arise... We will arise...
 
Lord, we are not ashamed
to proclaim Your name...
 
Jesus... [3x]
 
We will arise... We will arise...
 
Lord, we are not ashamed
to proclaim Your name
 
Jesus... [11x]
 
We will arise!
