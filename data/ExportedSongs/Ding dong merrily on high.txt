Ding dong merrily on high,
In heav'n the bells are ringing:
 
Ding dong! verily the sky
Is riv'n with angel singing.Gloria, Hosanna in excelsis!
 
E'en so here below, below,
Let steeple bells be swungen,
 
And ""Io, io, io!""
By priest and people sungen.
 
Gloria, Hosanna in excelsis!
 
Pray you, dutifully prime
Your matin chime, ye ringers;
 
May you beautifully rime
Your evetime song, ye singers.
 
Gloria, Hosanna in excelsis!
