So many times in life before,
I tried and tried to do things my way (hey, hey, hey)
 
I thought that I was smart enough, I thought I knew enough to (handle myself)
 
I didn't realize the problem was, the struggle was between my will and Yours
 
So I'm giving up my will for Yours, I'm totally depending on You (please come through)
 
Now when trouble comes my way, I don't cry, I just lift my eyes (to the hills)
 
'Cause Your word says my help is gonna come, I'm just gon rest in what
 
You say (hey, hey, hey)
 
'Cause I know every word You say is true
And every promise that You made it will come to
 
So no matter how long it takes
I'll be here still giving praise
 
Waiting on my change to come
 
I believe.....
Say yeah
 
I have no other choice
but to trust You
 
That's all I can do
I have no other choice
 
but to believe
