WHY ARE WE WEIGHED DOWN
AND IT SEEMS
 
THERE'S NO SOLUTION?
 
WHY DON'T WE LOOK UP
TO THE HOPE OF OUR SALVATION
 
CAN'T YOU SEE
OUR GOD IS FAITHFUL?
 
YESTERDAY, TODAY, FOREVER
 
EVERY TRIBE AND EVERY TONGUE
COME TO THE SON WHO'S BORN
 
THOSE WHO CALL ON HIM...
HE HAS PROMISED TO SAVE
 
COME LET US PRAISE!
LIFT UP YOUR EYES TO THE LORD
 
COME LET US PRAISE!
LIFT UP YOUR VOICE TO THE LORD
 
LIFT UP YOUR EYES!
LIFT UP YOUR VOICE!
 
LIFT UP YOUR HEART!
FOR IN HIS LOVE WE CAN REJOICE!
