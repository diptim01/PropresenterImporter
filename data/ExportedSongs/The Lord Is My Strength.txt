When The Wicked, My Enemies
Draw Upon Me To Bring Me Down
 
Iíll Put My Trust In You
Till My Enemies Cannot Be Found
 
One Thing Have I Desired
That Will I Seek After
 
To Dwell In Your House Oh Lord
Youíre My God, My King, My Master.
 
The Lord Is My Strength
My Salvation, My Light
 
My Help In Time Of Trouble
 
Tell Me Whom Shall I Fear
Whom Shall I Be Afraid Of (2x)
