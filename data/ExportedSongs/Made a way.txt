Made a way
 
Don't know how but you did it
Made a way
 
Standing here not knowing
how we'll get through this test
 
But holding onto faith you know best
Nothing can catch you by surprise
 
You've got this figured out and
you're watching us now
 
But when it looks as if we can't win
 
You wrap us in your arm and step in
And everything we need you supply
 
You got this in control
And now we know that
 
You made a way
 
When our backs were against the wall
And it looked as if it was over
 
You made a way
 
And we're standing here
Only because you made a way
 
You made a way
 
Now we're here
Looking back on where we come from
 
Because of you and nothing we've done
 
To deserve the love and mercy you've shown
 
Your grace was strong enough to pick us up
 
And you made a way
When our backs were against the wall
 
And it looked as if it was over
You made a way
 
And we're standing here
Only because you made a way [x2]
 
And we're standing here
Only because you made a way [x2]
 
You move mountains
You cause walls to fall
 
With your power
You perform miracles
 
There is nothing that's impossible
 
And we're standing here
Only because you made a way
 
You made a way [x4]
 
Don't know how but you did it
Made a way
 
Don't know how but you did it
Made a way
 
Don't know how but you did it [x4]
 
Don't know why but I'm grateful [x4]
 
Don't know how but I'm grateful
 
And we're standing here
Only because you made
 
And we're standing here
Only because you made a way
 
And we're standing here
Only because you made
 
You move mountain [x4]
 
You cause walls to fall [x4]
 
You cause chains to break [x4]
 
Giants fall [x4]
 
'Cause you move mountain
You move mountain
 
And everything is easy for you
'Cause you move mountain
 
Yes you move mountain
 
Mountains are moving [x4]
 
Strong holds are breaking [x4]
 
'Cause you move mountain
You cause walls to fall
 
With your power [x4]
 
You perform miracles [x4]
