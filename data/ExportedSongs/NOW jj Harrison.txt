Miracles are on the way;
Breakthrough is here today.
 
You don't have to cry no more,
All you lost shall be restored.
You just have to keep the faith.
 
Speak into the atmosphere,
And praise Him like it's already here.
 
Trust Him and believe,
By faith you shall receive
The blessings God has for you.
 
And now, let the weak say "I am strong,"
Let the poor say "I am rich,"
I believe He will do it
 
So I'm gonna praise Him.
Now, let the sick say "I am healed,"
Let the bound say "I am free"
 
He will keep His promise,
So I'm gonna praise Him now.
 
I'm healed... now. I'm free... now.
I'm restored... now. It's done... now. (repeat)
 
Now... (Now...) Now... (Now...)
Yes... (Yes...) I believe... (I believe...)
 
I believe... (I believe...)
I believe... (I believe...)
 
Now...
