We sing unto God with the voice of triumph
(We sing unto God with the voice of triumph)
 
We shout it aloud for our God is able
(We shout it aloud for our God is able)
 
Blessings and glory and honour
Dominion and power be unto our God
 
Glory to God, Glory to God
In the highest, in the highest
 
Glory to God
 
Clap your hands and praise the Lord now
Clap your hands and praise the Lord now
 
Shout Halleluyah
