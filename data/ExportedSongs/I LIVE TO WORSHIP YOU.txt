DOWN AT YOUR FEET OH LORD
IS THE MOST HIGH PLACE
 
IN YOUR PRESENCE LORD
I SEEK YOUR FACE,
 
I SEEK YOUR FACE
 
THERE IS NO HIGHER CALLING
NO GREATER HONOUR
 
THAN TO BOW AND KNEEL BEFORE YOUR THRONE
I'M AMAZED AT YOUR GLORY,
 
EMBRACED BY YOUR MERCY
O LORD, I LIVE TO WORSHIP YOU
 
O LORD
I LIVE TO WORSHIP YOU...
