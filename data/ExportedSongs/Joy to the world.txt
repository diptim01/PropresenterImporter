Joy to the world;
The Lord is come!
 
Let earth receive her King;
Let every heart..prepare Him room
 
And heaven and nature sing;
And heaven and nature sing;
And heaven and nature sing;
 
Joy to the world;
The Saviour reigns!
 
Let all their songs employ;
While fields and floods, rocks, hills, and plains...
 
Repeat the sounding joy;
Repeat the sounding joy;
Repeat the sounding joy;
 
No more let sins and sorrows grow;
Nor thorns infest the ground;
 
He comes to make..
His blessings flow
 
Far as the curse is found;
Far as the curse is found;
Far as the curse is found;
 
He rules the world;
With truth and grace;
 
And makes the nations prove;
The glories of His righteousness;
 
And wonders of His love;
And wonders of His love;
And wonders of His love;
