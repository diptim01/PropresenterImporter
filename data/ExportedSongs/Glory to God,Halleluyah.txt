We are never, never weary of the grand old song;
Glory to God, hallelujah!
 
We can sing it loud as ever,
with our faith more strong;
Glory to God, hallelujah!
 
O, the children of the Lord have a
right to shout and sing,
 
For the way is growing bright,
and our souls are on the wing;
 
We are going by and by to the palace of a king!
Glory to God, hallelujah!
 
We are lost amid the rapture of redeeming love
Glory to God, hallelujah!
 
We are rising on its pinions to the hills above:
Glory to God, hallelujah!
 
We are going to a palace that is built of gold;
Glory to God, hallelujah!
 
Where the King in all His splendor we shall soon behold
Glory to God, hallelujah!
 
There we’ll shout redeeming mercy in a glad, new song;
Glory to God, hallelujah!
 
There we’ll sing the praise of Jesus
with the blood washed throng;
Glory to God, hallelujah!
