This world sometimes seems cruel and cold
 
And pain doth pierce my very soul
 
But there's a place, a secret place
 
A place where I can go, ohh
 
A place of peace, where love abides
 
Where justice reigns and God resides
 
There is a place, a secret place
 
A place where I can go
 
For You shall hide me in Your tabernacle
 
From the rain and storm
 
And even when my enemies peruse me
 
You'll keep me safe from harm
 
And when my heart is filled with pain
 
No peace it seems I'll find again
 
I find that place a secret place
 
A place where I can go
 
For You shall hide me in Your tabernacle
 
From the rain and storm
 
And even when my enemies peruse me
 
You'll keep me safe from harm
 
There is safety, in Your tabernacle
 
There is protection, in Your tabernacle
 
There is security, in Your tabernacle
 
There is sanctuary, in Your tabernacle
 
Lord take me, to Your tabernacle
 
I wanna go, to Your tabernacle
 
Lord take me, to Your tabernacle
 
Lord there You'll reign,
 
hide me safely in Your dwelling place
 
There is a place a secret place
 
A place where I can go, ooh a secret place
 
A dwelling place, I wanna go, I wanna go
