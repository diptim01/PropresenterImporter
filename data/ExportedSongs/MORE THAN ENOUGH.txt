WHEN THE WORLD TURNS ITÃ­S BACK
AND IT FEELS LIKE THE END
 
OH LORD, YOU ARE MORE THAN ENOUGH
WHEN WE'RE WOUNDED AND BROKEN
 
AND WE'RE NEEDING A FRIEND
OH LORD, YOU ARE MORE THAN EBOUGH
 
WHEN WE'VE DONE ALL WE KNOW
AND WE'RE FACING DEFEAT
 
OH LORD, YOU ARE MORE THAN ENOUGH
WHEN YOUR WORD SAYS HOLD ON
 
BUT THE WORLD SAYS RETREAT
OH LORD, YOU ARE MORE THAN ENOUGH
 
OH LORD, YOU ARE MORE THAN ENOUGH
 
A WELLSPRING OF MERCY AND A FOUNTAIN OF LOVE
 
WE LIVE TO PRAISE YOUR AMAZING GRACE
OH LORD, YOU ARE MORE THAN ENOUGH
 
PRECIOUS LORD, YOU ARE MORE THAN ENOUGH
 
MUCH MORE THAN WE ASK OR IMAGINE
THAT'S WHAT YOUR LOVE CAN DO
 
AND LORD WHEN YOUR LOVE FEELS OUR WEAKNESS
IT'S MORE THAN ENOUGH TO LIFT UP TO YOU.
