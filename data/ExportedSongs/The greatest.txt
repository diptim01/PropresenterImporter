God You are
Lord of All
 
You're simply the Greatest to me
The things you do
 
No one can do
It was only You
 
You have made my life brand new
God You took away my wrong
 
And mistakes from my past
 
You are the Greatest
You're simply Amazing
 
God how Your love has captured me
You withheld Your judgement
 
And showed me mercy
God I'm so glad for another chance
 
You are the Greatest
 
God You know
Everything about me
 
And I'm so glad
That You still choose me
 
Your Greatness I can see
God took away my wrongs
 
And the mistakes from my past
 
You are… You are….
God You're Great.. You do Great things
 
Oh Oh Oh….
You are Greater
