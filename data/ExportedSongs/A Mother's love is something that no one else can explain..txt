" A Mother's love is something
that no one else can explain.
 
It is made of deep, devoted sacrifice and pain
 
It is endless and unselfish;
 
enduring come what may
 
For nothing can destroy it or take that love away
 
It is patient and forgiving
 
When all others have forsaken, it never fails or falters even if the heart is breaking
 
It believes beyond believing even
when the world rather condemns
 
and... it glows with all the
beauty of the rarest brightest gems
 
- It is certainly far beyond definition. It defies all explanation; it remains a mysteries of creation.
 
- a miracle beyond man's comprehension and another wondrous display of God's splendor.
 
- nothing lights the path greater than any earthly love I know than a Mother's love."
 
God bless...
