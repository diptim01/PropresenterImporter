There's no question of Your greatness,
No searching of Your power.
 
All the wonder of Your glory
To You forty years is but one hour.
 
Your knowledge is all encompassing,
To Your wisdom there is no end;
 
For You alone are God,
You are God alone.
 
Your mercy is everlasting,
Your truth is here always.
 
You are He who was and is, and is to come.
Who is he that can number Your day,
 
You've flung the sun to burn in space,
And the night's moon powers light from day;
 
You are God alone.
 
Now unto the KING,
eternal, immortal, invisible,
 
The only wise God,
The only wise God;
 
You alone are God,
For You are God alone.
 
For You alone are GOD,
You are GOD alone
 
Be all glory and honor,
dominion, and power
 
Forever and ever,
AMEN
