DRAW ME CLOSE TO YOU NEVER LET ME GO
I LAY IT ALL DOWN AGAIN
 
TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT I'M YOUR FRIEND
 
YOU ARE MY DESIRE
NO ONE ELSE WILL DO
 
CAUSE NOTHING ELSE CAN TAKE YOUR PLACE
TO FEEL THE WARMTH OF YOUR EMBRACE
 
HELP ME FIND A WAY
BRING ME BACK TO YOU
 
YOU'RE ALL I WANT
YOU'RE ALL I EVER NEEDED
 
YOU'RE ALL I WANT
HELP ME KNOW YOU ARE NEAR
 
HELP ME KNOW YOU ARE NEAR...
 
HELP ME KNOW
YOU ARE NEAR
