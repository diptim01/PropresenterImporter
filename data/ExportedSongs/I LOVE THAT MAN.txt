I LOVE THAT MAN OF GALILEE
FOR HE HAS DONE SO VERY MUCH FOR ME
 
HE HAS FORGIVEN ME ALL MY SINS AND SENT THE HOLY GHOST TO ME
 
I LOVE THAT MAN OF GALILEE
 
i love the lord
 
I love the Lord,he heard my cry
And pitied every groan,long as I,live
 
And troubles rise,I hasten to his throne
 
I hasten to his throne
