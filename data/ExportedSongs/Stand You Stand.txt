I decided to take a stand
Not knowing I'll lose my best friend
 
But I'd rather; I'd rather live right
Than in hell lift up my eyes
 
All of Gods children just stand
Tell somebody say you stand
 
Eh Lord eh
 
Stand for Holiness
 
Stand for Righteousness
And be counted among them
 
That shall reign with Him
 
You stand
When friends are gone
 
Stand when you're all alone
And believe He shall receive His own
 
I decided to take a stand
 
Not believing I'd lose
Some of my friends
 
I would rather; I'd rather live right
Than in hell lift up my eyes.

And believe He shall receive His own(x3)
 
Everybody stand up and say
Stand for Holiness
