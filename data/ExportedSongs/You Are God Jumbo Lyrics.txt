Demons tremble at your voice
Sickness bows before you
 
Nothing can hold me down
Forever you are King of Kings
 
All power is in your hands
what can keep me from your love
 
so we will shout it out
till the whole world knows that
 
Jesus, You are God alone
 
You are God 3x
You are God alone..
 
O.O.O.O
O.O.O.O
 
You are more than words can say
Stronger than ten thousand
 
with you all things are possible
you have over come the grave.
 
All power is in your hands
what can keep me from your love
 
so we will shout it out
till the whole world knows that
 
Jesus, You are God alone
 
Living in the over flow
Jesus you have overcome
 
given me the victory
am more than a conquerer
