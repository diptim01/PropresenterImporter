While shepherds kept their watching,
O'er silent flocks by night;
 
Behold throughout the heavens,
There shone a holy light.
 
The shepherds feared and trembled,
When lo above the earth;
 
Rang out the angel chorus,
That hailed our Savior's birth.
 
Go tell it on the mountain,
Over the hills and everywhere;
 
Go tell it on the mountain,
That Jesus Christ is born.
 
Down in a lowly manger,
Our humble Christ was born;
 
And God send us salvation,
That blessed Christmas morn.
 
And if I am a Christian,
I am the least of all.
 
They traveled on together
To where the Babe was laid.
 
And lo, when they had seen it,
They all bowed down and prayed;
 
When I was a seeker,
I sought both night and day;
 
I asked the Lord to help me,
And He showed me the way.
 
He made me a watchman,
Upon the city wall;
