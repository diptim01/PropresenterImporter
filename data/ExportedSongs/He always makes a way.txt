I see you crying,
I see you hurt
 
I see you reach,
I know you're worried
 
For all your struggles and all your troubles
Too much to handle,what do you do
 
There's one thing that you must
remember about my God
 
He always makes a way
 
I know the situation dim,and you can't see Him
But he always makes a way
 
You're not in this by yourself
When there's no one else
 
He always makes a way
 
I know you think about tomorrow
but don't forget about yesterday
 
He brought you through,
he helped you make it
 
Through all the pain,
He will come through
 
There's one thing that you must
remember about my God
 
He always makes a way
 
He always,always….makes a way
 
Makes a way,makes a way
 
He always makes a way,
makes a way,makes a way
 
He always makes a way
 
He always makes a way…..oh yes
 
He will,He will make a way,
Oh yes He will
 
Don't You lose the faith,
just know today that he will
 
He always makes a way,
He will make a way
 
Don't you lose the faith,
Just know today that He will
 
He always makes  a way,
He will make a way
 
Don't you give up,
just know somehow He will
 
He always makes a way,
He will make a way
 
Don't you lose the faith,
just know today that He will
 
He always makes a way,
He will make a way
 
Don't you give up now,
Just know somehow that He will.
