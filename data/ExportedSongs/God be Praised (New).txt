God be praised
God be praised
Let the name of the Lord be praised
 
Oh, God be praised
God be praised
Let the name of the Lord be praised...
 
From the rising of the sun
To the setting of the same
 
Let the name of the Lord be praised
And until my dying day
 
When there's no more I can say
Let the name of the Lord be praised
 
Praise ye the Lord,
Praise God in the sanctuary,
Praise Him in the firmament of His power.
 
Oh, praise ye the Lord,
Praise God in the sanctuary,
 
Praise Him, praise Him
Praise ye the Lord
