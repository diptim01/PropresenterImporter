Pregnant possibilities now birth anew,
travailing to obtain it for it must come to pass.
 
I decree it, declare it, and call it in the Spirit
to become what God's designed me to be.
 
Your future, your promises shall be fulfilled,
yes, you shall obtain it for it must come to pass.
 
I decree it, declare it,
and call it in the Spirit.
 
Manifest, manifest,
manifest, manifest.
 
Become what God's designed me to be.
Become what God's designed you to be.
Become what God's designed you to be.
