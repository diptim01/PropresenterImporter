Great and Mighty are you Lord,
Forever we will sing.
 
Great and Mighty are you Lord,
 
Our great and matchless King.
[x5]
 
King of all Kings, Lord of all Lords,
We worship you with one accord.
 
Ancient of Days, Lamb who was slain,
Your Kingdom reigns from age to age!
 
Lord, we give you the praise.
 
For the rest of our days
We exalt your holy name!
 
Great God...
 
Oh-oh, oh-oh...
 
Our great and matchless King. [x2]
