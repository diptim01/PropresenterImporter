WHO TAUGHT THE SUN
WHERE TO STAND IN THE MORNING?
 
WHO TOLD THE OCEAN YOU CAN ONLY COME THIS FAR?
 
WHO SHOWED THE MOON
WHERE TO HIDE TILL EVENING?
 
WHOSE WORDS ALONE CAN
CATCH A FALLING STAR?
 
THAT VERY SAME GOD
THAT SPINS THINGS  IN ORBIT
 
CALLS TO THE WEARY
THE WORN AND THE WEAK
 
AND THE SAME GENTLE HANDS
THAT HOLD ME WHEN I'M BROKEN
 
THEY CONQUERED DEATH
TO BRING ME VICTORY!
 
I KNOW MY REDEEMER LIVES (2X)
ALL OF CREATION TESTIFY
 
THIS LIFE WITHIN ME CRIES
I KNOW MY REDEEMER LIVES
 
HE LIVES
TO TAKE AWAY MY SHAME
 
AND HE LIVES
FOREVER I'LL PROCLAIM
 
THAT THE PAYMENT FOR MY SIN
WAS THE PRECIOUS LIFE HE GAVE
 
BUT NOW, HE'S ALIVE AND
THERE'S AN EMPTY GRAVE
 
HE  LIVES.......
