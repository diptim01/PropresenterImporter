I stand amazed in the presence
Of Jesus the Nazarene.
 
And wonder how He could love me,
A sinner, condemned and unclean.
 
For me it was in the garden
He prayed "Not My will but Thine."
 
He had no tears for His own griefs,
But sweat drops of blood for mine.
 
In pity angels behold Him,
And came from the world of light
 
To comfort Him in the sorrows
He bore for my soul that night.
 
He took my sins and my sorrows;
He made them His very own;
 
He bore the burden to Calvary,
And suffered and died alone.
 
When with the ransomed in glory
His face I at last shall see,
 
'Twill be my joy through the ages
To sing of His love for me.
 
How marvelous! how wonderful!
And my song shall ever be:
 
How marvelous, how wonderful
Is my Savior's love for me!
