Can't nobody love me like you do
No other love I know is pure and true
 
So mighty is his love that
brought me through
 
Oh gracious God
Thankful that you are a friend indeed
 
You are the sacrifice that made me free
No other love I know compares to thee
 
O gracious God
Thatís why I love ya
 
No other God before ya
Thatís why I love ya
 
I want more of ya
No greater love
 
Than the love of God
 
Oh I really love him
Oh canít live without him
 
Oh, no one before him
Oh, be more of him
 
Nobody loves me better
 
Canít nobody love me better
Make me happy
 
Make me feel this way
