Wonderful love that rescued me,
Sunk deep in sin.
 
Guilty and vile as I could be,
No hope within.
 
When every ray of light had fled,
O glorious day.
 
Raising my soul from out the dead,
Love found the way.
 
Love brought my Saviour here
To die on Calvary
 
For such a sinful wretch as I.
How can it be?
 
Love bridged the gulf
Twixt me and heaven,
 
Taught me to pray.
I am redeemed, set free, forgiven.
 
Love found a way.
 
Love opened wide the gates of light
To heaven's domain.
 
Where in eternal power and might
Jesus shall reign.
 
Love lifted me from depths of woe,
To endless day.
 
There was no help in earth below.
Love found a way.
 
Love found a way to redeem my soul.
Love found a way that could make me whole.
 
Love sent my Lord to the cross of shame.
Love found a way, O praise His holy name.
