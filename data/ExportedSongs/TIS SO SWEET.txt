Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus,
Just to take Him at His word;
 
Just to rest upon His promise,
Just to know "Thus saith the Lord"
 
Yes, 'tis sweet to trust in Jesus,
Just from sin and self to cease;
 
Just from Jesus simply taking
Life and rest, and joy and peace.
 
I'm so glad I learned to trust Him,
Precious Jesus, saviour, friend;
 
And I know that He is with me,
Will be with me to the end.
 
Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him!
How I've proved Himo'er and o'er!
 
jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!
O for grace to trust Him more!
 
O how sweet to trust in Jesus,
Just to trust His cleansing blood;
 
Just in simple faith to plunge me
"Neath the healing, cleansing flood!
