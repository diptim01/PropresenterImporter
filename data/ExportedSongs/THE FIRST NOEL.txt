The first Noel the angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
 
In fields where they
lay, all keeping their sheep
 
On a cold winter's
night that was so deep
 
And by the light of a great star,
Three Wise Men came
 
from country far
To seek for a King was their intent,
 
And to follow the
star wherever it went
 
This star drew nigh
to the north-west
 
Over Bethlehem it took its rest;
And there it did both stop and stay
 
Right over the place
where Jesus lay
 
Then entered in those
Wise Men three
 
Fell reverently upon their knee,
And offered there in His presence,
 
Their gold and
myrrh and frankincense
 
Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our Heavenly Lord
 
That hath made Heaven
and earth of nought,
 
And with His blood
mankind has bought
 
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel
