Everything has changed for me
Everything has changed for me
 
Everything has changed
 
I'm grateful for the blessing oh God
You dey increase my testimony
 
See all the things you've blessed me with oh God  you no dey fall my hand
 
You no dey stress me oh Lord
You no dey make me sweat Oghene me
 
But you still dey bless me Ka bi o si
You no dey fall my hand
 
No more weeping only
blessings all the way
 
No more sadness
only blessing all the way
 
No more sorrow only blessings all the way
No more sickness
