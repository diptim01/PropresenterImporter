Troubles come and troubles go this I know
 
And like a branch given to the vine I will grow
No need to worry in what's gonna be tomorrow
 
I know with time God's gonna show
Praise to God creator of heaven and the earth
 
He who is the beginning and the earth
He whose life love grace and mercy never end
 
Give Him praise until the end
 
Iyin ye Olorun mi
Oba to gbo adura (X2)
 
Would I need God if I could do things on my own
 
Need i comfort if I never felt all alone
Can there be a harvest If in tears I hadn't sown
 
God is with me I'm not alone  ..oh
While I live i'll give Him praise through my tears
 
Letting His word replacing my faith for my fears
I do believe that when I pray God hears
 
Soon He will come through for me
 
I praise You though I am in pain (in pain..)
 
Shine your light on  me I pray (shine your light)
Saviour please come hold my hands
 
Lead me to Your...lead me to Your rest
 
Eh oh eh oh ah eh eh oh eh oh
 
Eh oh eh oh ah eh ohhhh
(X3)
 
Eh oh eh oh ah eh eh oh eh oh
 
Iyin ye oh
Iyin ye oh oh Baba mimo (X4)
 
You are worthy...
