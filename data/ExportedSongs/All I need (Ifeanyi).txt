Father I've come to You
 
I've come to Worship You
Before Your Holy Throne
 
Declaring You are God
I'm nothing Lord without You
 
I could never be without You
oh oh God all I need is You
 
Father I've come to you
 
I've come to Worship You
Before Your Holy Throne
 
Declaring You are God
I'm nothing Lord Without You
 
I could never be without You
oh oh God all I need is You (x2)
 
All I need is You
Your enough for me
 
I want to be with You each day
Cause in Your presence is where I rather be
 
Oh oh God all I need is You x2
 
All I need is You
 
Your enough for me
I want to be with You each day
 
Cause in Your presence is where I rather be
Oh oh God all I need is You
 
Oh oh God all I need is You
 
Left my fear by the side of the road
 
Left my fear by the side of the road
 
Hear You speak...Won't let go
 
Fall to my knees
 
As I lift my hands to pray
 
Got every reason to be here again
 
Father's love that draws me in
 
And all my eyes wanna see
 
Is a glimpse of You
 
All I need is You….
 
All I need is You Lord…Is You Lord…(x2)..All I need is You….
 
One more day and it's not the same
 
Your Spirit calls my heart to sing
 
Drawn to the voice of my Saviour once again
 
Where would my soul be without Your Son
 
Gave His life to save the earth
 
Rest in the thought that You're watching over me
 
All I need is You...
 
All I need is You Lord….Is You Lord(x4)… All I need is You
 
You hold the universe...You hold everyone on earth
 
You hold the universe… You hold
 
You hold
(X4)
 
All I need is You… All I need is You Lord
 
Is You Lord
 
All I need is You Lord
 
All I need is You Lord
You Lord
 
All I need is You
