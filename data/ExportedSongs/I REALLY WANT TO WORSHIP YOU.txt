YOU LAID ASIDE
YOUR MAJESTY
 
GAVE UP EVERYTHING FOR ME
SUFFERED AT THE HANDS
 
OF THOSE YOU HAVE CREATED
 
YOU TOOK ALL
MY GUILT AND SHAME
 
WHEN YOU DIED
AND ROSE AGAIN
 
NOW TODAY YOU REIGN
IN HEAVEN AND EARTH EXALTED
 
I REALLY WANT TO WORSHIP YOU MY LORD
YOU HAVE WON MY HEART AND I AM YOURS
 
FOREVER AND EVER,
I WILL LOVE YOU
 
YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE
WHO DIED FOR ME
 
YOU GAVE YOUR
LIFE TO SET ME FREE
 
SO I LIFT MY VOICE TO YOU
IN ADORATION
 
IN ADORATION...
