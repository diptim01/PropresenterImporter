Intro 2:
 
As I look around and I see
All the works that
 
Your hands have made
The awesomeness of You
 
And how Your love
will never fail
 
Mere words cannot
express what I feel inside
 
I can't describe
Your glory divine
 
But as a token of my love
This is what I'll do
 
I lift my hands and cry holy
 
There's not enough
words that I can say
 
To tell you how
much I appreciate
 
All the wonderful things
You've given me Your loving kindness
 
Your tender mercies
It's my desire to praise You
 
And tell you how
much I love You
 
You're worthy of
all the honor
 
Lord You're worthy
of all the praise
