Have yourself a merry Blessed Christmas,
Let your heart be light
 
From now on,
our troubles will be out of sight
 
Have yourself a merry Blessed Christmas,
Make the Yule-tide great,
 
From now on,
our troubles will be miles away
 
Here we are as in olden days,
Happy golden days of yore.
 
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more.
 
Through the years
We all will be together,
 
If the Good Lord wills
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough.
 
And have yourself A merry Blessed Christmas now.
 
And have yourself A merry Blessed Christmas now.
