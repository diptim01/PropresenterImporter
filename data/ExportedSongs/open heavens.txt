The past has a way of returning to negatively impact upon the present, and possibly destroying the joy of the future.
Esau was a victim of his ugly past. Reuben was another victimof the past. Around us today are several victims or victims-to-be. Some are very conscious of the toll their past is taking on them. Some unfortunately are not discerning enough to tracewhat they are going through to its source in the past. The truth is that every event has its origin - its roots. It is unfortunate to think that forgetting your past will solve the problems of thepast. This will only work if you , like Apostle Paul take practical steps to destroy the evil seeds you sowed. If you do nothing about your negative past, be sure that sooner or latter, you willbecome a casualty of your past.
According to Jeremiah 31:29-30, it is not possible to take sour grapes and your teeth not be on edge. If youkilled in the past and became a believer in Christ, you have to restitute. Sweeping past evil deeds under the carpet can only secretly multiply their retribution before itcatches up with the fellow. Any covenant made as an unbeliever with the kingdom of darkness can still affect you after receiving Christ, if you failed to take conscious steps to renounce it in theName of Jesus Christ. Did you acquire your certificates by fraud? Did somebody else sit for your exams and today you are presenting that certificate as yours? It is a fraudulent seed from thepast that will surely catch up with you, except you confront it and restitute. Did you fake your admission into the university and you have even completed one, two or more years? You arebuilding on a foundation that will surely crumble. Repent, restitute and start all over again! Paul did something about his past before he left the rest in God's hands. At such a time,it was safe to forget the past. Did you steal and still retain the stolen item in your custody? Return it to the owner. Even if you have spent what was stolen, go and restitute to the one youstole from and if the fellow asks for full repayment, you have no option than to fully repay. However, handle this with care. Many blessings have been lost to the intrusion of the past. Dosomething about your past!
 
ACTION POINT:
Many Christian adults sowed their wild oats out of ignorance. As a Christian parent, prayerfully ensure your children do not sow seeds that would erode theirfuture.
