Father in heaven how we love You
 
We lift Your name in all the earth.
 
May Your kingdom be established in our praises,
 
As Your people we declare Your mighty works!
 
Oh God most Holy we adore You,
 
We lay our all before Your throne.
 
May the fragrance of Your presence be about us
 
As we purpose to worship You alone!
 
Blessed be the Lord God Almighty
 
Who was, and is, and is to come.
 
Blessed be the Lord God Almighty
 
Who reigns forevermore.
 
Who reigns forevermore...
