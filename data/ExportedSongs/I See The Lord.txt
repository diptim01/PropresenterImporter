THE TRAIN OF HIS ROBES
FILL THE TEMPLE
 
A CLOUD OF
HEAVENLY WORSHIPPERS
 
SURROUNDING HIS THRONE
WE JOIN WITH THEM NOW CRYING HOLY,
 
HOLY IS THE LAMB
THE LAMB OF GOD
 
I SEE THE LORD (2X)
EXALTED HIGH ABOVE THE WORSHIP
 
OF THE PEOPLE OF THE EARTH
I SEE THE LORD (2x)
 
FOR MY EYES HAVE SEEN
THE KING
 
THE LAMB UPON THE THRONE
WHO REIGNS FOREVER MORE
 
I SEE THE LORD (2X)
MY EYES HAVE SEEN THE KING
 
MY EYES HAVE SEEN THE KING
 
THE LAMB UPON THE THRONE
WHO REIGNS FOREVER MORE
