SPIRIT OF THE SOVEREIGN LORD
COME AND MAKE YOUR PRESENCE KNOWN
 
REVEAL THE GLORY OF THE LIVING GOD
 
WE DO NOT SEEK YOUR HAND
WE ONLY SEEK YOUR FACE
 
WE WANT TO KNOW YOU
WE WANT TO SEE YOU
 
REVEAL YOUR GLORY IN THIS PLACE
 
LET THE WEIGHT OF YOUR GLORY COVER US
LET THE LIFE OF YOUR RIVER FLOW
 
LET THE TRUTH OF YOUR KINGDOM REIGN IN US
LET THE WEIGHT OF YOUR GLORY
 
LET THE WEIGHT OF YOUR GLORY FALL
 
Ending 1:
LET THE WEIGHT OF YOUR GLORY
 
LET THE WEIGHT OF YOUR GLORY FALL
