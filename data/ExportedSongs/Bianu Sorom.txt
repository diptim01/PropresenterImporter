You might be weak and heavy laden
Though trials seem to weigh you down
 
Your fellow man, they hook you up and free themselves
Leaving you in the valley of pain and rejection
 
Weeping may endure for a night
But your joy will come in the morning….
 
Just lift up your hands and praise Jehovah…
And He will raise you Up….
