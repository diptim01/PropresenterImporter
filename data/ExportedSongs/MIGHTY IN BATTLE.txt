THERE IS A BATTLE AGAINST YOU AND ME
BUT NOT A WAR THAT OUR EYES CAN SEE
 
WE WRESTLE NOT AGAINST FLESH AND BLOOD
BUT POWER AND PRINCIPALITY
 
SO WE MUST TAKE UP OUR SPIRITUAL WEAPON
AND WE MUST SEEK THE REFUSE OF GOD
 
FOR HE IS A STRONG AND MIGHTY TOWER
THE DEVIL IS DEFEATED TODAY BY HIS POWER
 
THE LORD OUR GOD IS STRONG AND MIGHTY
THE LORD OUR GOD IS MIGHTY IN BATTLE
 
SOUND THE ALARM FROM THE HOLY MOUNTAIN
WONDERFUL, POWERFUL
 
MIGHTY IS HIS POWER
 
WHO IS THE KING OF GLORY (2CE)
