Born to win
Born to reign in life
 
I'm no ordinary person
I'm destined for greatness
 
Circumstances may come to challenge me
Situation may come just to end me
 
But when they turn me to the left and right
They realize that I am the light
 
When my brothers look at me and despise me
When my sisters turn to mock and reject me
 
They are surprised that I'm standing strong
And I tell them look it won't be long
 
Don't look at me like you know me before
I'm not the one that you use to know
 
Jesus Christ is the one that I adore
He who brings the best in me to show
 
Never mind what I am going through
I assure that I will come through
 
I am destined for greatness, created for success
Can't you see that it's flowing in me
 
See the seed of God is in me
And the grace of God upon me
 
I don't have a choice
I am made for the top
 
With the seed of God inside of you
And the grace of God upon you
 
You don't have a choice
You've been made for the top
 
I am (I am)
Born to win (born to win)
 
You are (you are)
Born to win (born to win)
 
We are (we are)
Born to win (born to win)
 
I'm no ordinary person I'm destined for greatness
 
You are no ordinary person
you are destined for greatness
 
Born unto us this day a Saviour

A light for all mankind
