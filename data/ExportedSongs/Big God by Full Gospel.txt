My God is big
So Strong so Mighty
 
My God's plans for me
Goes beyond my wildest dream
 
My God is good
So good to me
 
(Say yeah) Yeah, Yeah, Yea, Yeah
So good to me Yeah, Yeah, Yeah……2x
 
(Say yeah) Yeah, Yeah, Yea, Yeah
So good to me Yeah, Yeah, Yeah……2x
 
He's my God and he's my refuge
He's the rock on which I stand
 
He's my fortress, My God He is my light
He holds the oceans in his hand
 
There is nothing my God cannot do….(repeat)
 
If you know he's big God lemme hear you say it now
"Whoo!
 
If He's still making ways, lift your praise…
Whoo! Whoo!
 
What a mighty mighty mighty God we serve "Whow!
 
My God is big
So Strong so Mighty
 
My God's plan for me
Goes beyond my wildest dream
