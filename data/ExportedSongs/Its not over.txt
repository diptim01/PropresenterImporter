Its Not Over, Its Not Finished
Its Not Ending, Its Only The Beginning
 
When God Is In It, All Things Are New
All Things Are New
 
I Know Its Darkest Just Before Dawn
Might Be The Hardest Season You Experience
 
I Know It Hurts, Wont Be Too Long
You're Closer Than You Think You Are
You're Closer Than Youve Been Before
 
Look To The Sky, Help Is On The Way
Its Not Over, Its Not Finished
 
Its Not Ending, Its Only The Beginning
When God Is In It All Things Are New
 
All Things Are New
Something Is Moving, Turning Around
 
Seasons Are Changing, Everything Is Different Now
Here Comes The Sun, Piercing The Clouds
 
You're Closer Than You Think You Are
You're Closer Than You've Been Before
 
Look To The Sky, Help Is On The Way
Our God Is Faithful (Faithful To Say)
 
Its Not Over, Its Not Finished
Its Not Ending, Its Only The Beginning
 
Its Not Over, Its Not Finished
Its Not Ending, Its Only The Beginning
 
When God Is In It
When God Is In It
 
When God Is In It, There Is No Limit
When God Is In It, Its Not Over
 
Its Not Over
When God Is In It, There Is No Limit
 
When God Is In It, Its Not Over
When God Is In It, There Is No Limit
When God Is In It, Its Not Over
 
Its Not Over, Til God Says So
So I Count It All Joy
 
He'll Make All Things New
Its Not Over, Til God Says So
 
So I Count It All Joy
Its Not Over, Its Not Over
 
Its Not Over, Til God Says So
So I Count It All Joy
 
He'll Make All Things New
Its Not Over, Til God Says So
 
So I Count It All Joy
Its Not Over, Its Not Over, Its Not Over, Its Not Over
Its Not Over
