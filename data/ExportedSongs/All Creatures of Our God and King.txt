All creatures of our God and King,
Lift up your voice and with us sing,
 
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Thou burning sun with golden beam,
 
Thou silver moon with softer gleam,
O praise Him, O praise Him!
 
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!
 
Thou rushing wind that art so strong,
Ye clouds that sail in heaven along,
 
O praise Him! Alleluia!
Thou rising morn, in praise rejoice;
 
Ye lights of evening, find a voice!
O praise Him, O praise Him!
 
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!
 
Thou flowing water, pure and clear,
Make music for thy Lord to hear.
 
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Thou fire so masterful and bright,
 
Thou givest man both warmth and light!
O praise Him, O praise Him!
 
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!
 
And all ye men of tender heart,
Forgiving others take your part.
 
O sing ye! Alleluia!
Ye who long pain and sorrow bear,
 
Praise God and on Him cast your care!
O praise Him, O praise Him!
 
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!
 
Let all things their Creator bless,
And worship Him in humbleness.
 
O praise Him! Alleluia!
Praise, praise the Father, praise the Son,
 
And praise the Spirit, Three in One!
O praise Him! O praise Him!
 
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!
 
Earth ever fertile day by day,
Bring forth Your blessings on our way,
 
O praise Him! Alleluia!
All fruit and crops that richly grow,
 
All trees and flowers God's glory show.
O praise Him! O praise Him!
 
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!
