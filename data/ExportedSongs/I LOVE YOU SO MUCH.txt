Hear these praises
From a  grateful heart
 
Each time I think of  YOU
The praises start

LORD I love YOU
My soul sings
 
In  YOUR Presence
Carried on YOUR Wings

How my soul longs for  YOU,
Longs to worship
 
YOU forever,
In YOUR Power and Majesty
 
I lift my hands
I lift my heart
 
I lift my voice
Towards the Heavens
 
For YOU are my
Sun and Shield
 
I Love YOU so much
JESUS!
