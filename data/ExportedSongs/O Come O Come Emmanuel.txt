O come, O come Emmanuel
And ransom captive Israel,
 
That mourns in lonely exile here
Until the Son of God appear.
 
O come, Thou Rod of Jesse,
Free Thine own from Satan's tyranny;
 
From depths of hell Thy people save
And give them victory o'er the grave.
 
O come, Thou Dayspring come
And cheer our spirits by Thine advent here;
 
And drive away the shades of night
And pierce the clouds and bring us light.
 
O come, Thou Key of David come,
And open wide our heavenly home;
 
Make safe the way that leads on high
And close the path to misery.
 
O come, Thou Wisdom from on high
And order all things far and nigh;
 
To us the path of knowledge show
And cause us in her ways to go.
 
O come, Desire of nations,
Bind all peoples in one heart and mind;
 
Bid envy, strife, and quarrels cease;
Fill all the world with heaven's peace.
 
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel,
Shall come to Thee, O Israel!
