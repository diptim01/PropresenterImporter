It is coming from my heart,
Praise and thanks unto you lord,
 
For all the things that you have done
I'm grateful for your love..I give you the praise
 
I'm counting my blessings
I just cant keep it to myself
 
When I thought that he had done too much oh oh oh.. Jesus did it again..x 2
 
I can tell it now, oh
Am shouting loud...From the mountains top
 
I dance and praise the lord x4
 
I clap and praise the lord x4
 
I clap and praise the lord x4
 
I shout and praise the lord x4
 
And when I thought that he done too much oh oh oh, Jesus did it again.
 
I shout and praise the lord x4
And when I thought that he done too much oh oh oh,
Jesus did it again.
 
I can tell it now, oh
Am shouting loud
From the mountains top
