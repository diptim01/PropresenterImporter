When I close my eyes
and think of you
 
And reminisce of all
the things you do
 
I can't imagine my life without you
It's like paradise now
 
I know that it's real
 
It's a mystery for someone to give their life just for me
 
Whatcha did on Calvary makes me wanna love you more
 
Never thought that
I would smile again
 
Never thought the
dark clouds would end
 
Never thought that
I would have a friend
 
That would keep me
never leave me alone
 
Jesus you're my everything
The only one that makes my heart sing (heart sing)
 
Now I know what real love means its everlasting, lasting
 
Never thought that
I would smile again
 
Never thought the
dark clouds would end
 
Never thought that
I would have a friend
 
That would keep me
never leave me alone
 
Jesus you're my everything
The only one that makes my heart sing
 
Now I know what real love means its everlasting, lasting
 
I never knew I could be so happy
And I never knew I'd be so secure
 
Because of your love, life has brand new meaning
It's gonna be a brighter day, brighter day
 
Nothing can compare to
the joy you bring
 
And everlasting love affair
Jesus my life will never
 
be the same
I found someone who truly cares (cares)!
 
Brighter Day !
 
Broken but I'm Healed
 
So you enter into this building,
you brought your burdens, brought your pain.
 
I have a message for you today,
that when you leave here, you won't be the same.
 
So you tell me you've been to your physician,
look at you there's been no change in your condition.
 
Reach out and touch the Master's Throne,
there's healing for your mind,
your body, and your soul.
 
God can heal, He can deliver.
He can mend your brokenness.
 
He has a miracle to fit your needs,
once you trust Him, you will receive.
 
God knows about your situation,
but with every test and every trial there is revelation,
 
that God is able to supply every one of your needs;
He's here to touch you, heal you, He'll set you free.
 
So by the time that you leave this building,
my prayer for everyone in here
is that you'll have your healing.
 
Once God works a miracle to fit your need,
go tell the world, what you have received.
 
God has healed, He has delivered.
He has mended my brokenness.
 
Gave me a miracle to fit my need;
praise the Lord, praise the Lord, praise the Lord.
 
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, I have received.
