In the little village of Bethlehem,
There lay a Child one day;
 
And the sky was bright with a holy light,
O'er the place where Jesus lay.
 
'Twas a humble birthplace,
But oh, how much God gave to us that day;
 
From the manger bed what a path has led,
What a perfect holy way.
 
Alleluia! O how the angels sang!
Alleluia! How it rang!
 
And the sky was bright with a holy light,
'Twas the birthday of a King.
 
Ending 1:
O come, let us adore Him;
 
O come, let us adore Him,
Christ, the Lord.
 
'Twas the birthday of a Savior.
Alleluia! Allelulia!
 
'Twas the birthday of a King.
