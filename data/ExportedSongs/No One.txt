I whisper words about you endlessly
Mostly to myself because you make me believe
And never would there be a time I didn't know
 
No one could ever love me like you
couldThere would be a day I'd be alone
 
Cause no one could ever love me like you could
 
You have been the one who fulfills my dreams
I'll never let you go
 
If you stay with me
I promise you would know
 
Of all the times I've reached out for you
Oh, can't you see how I adore you
 
I couldn't spend my life without you
Please believe me I will neverdoubt you
 
You've been the one to answer all my prayers
Anytime I need you I know that you'll be there
 
Cause no one could ever love me like you couldI'm hoping that you'll hear
these prayers of mine
 
I'm hoping that we'll be together for all times
Cause no one could ever love me like you could
 
You have been the one who fulfills my dreams
I'll never let you go
 
If you stay with me
I promise you would know
 
Of all the times I've reached out for you
Oh, can't you see how I adore you
 
I couldn't spend my life without you
Please believe me I will neverdoubt you
 
Oh I would do anything for you to share that place in my heart
Please let me be the one
 
It would mean everything
There'll be no one to keep us apart
 
Of all the times I've reached out for you
Oh, can't you see how I adore you
 
I couldn't spend my life without you
Please believe me I will neverdoubt you
