Jesus is our Savior, He arose
Wonderful Creator, He arose
 
There is no one greater,
He arose.
 
He Arose.
 
Some of them denied Him, He arose
And then they crucified Him, He arose
 
At the tomb they couldn't find Him,
He arose.
 
He arose.
 
I believe in the resurrection of God's Son
In the resurrection of God's Son
 
I can feel the earth still shakin'
Every morning I awaken
 
To the resurrection of God's Son.
