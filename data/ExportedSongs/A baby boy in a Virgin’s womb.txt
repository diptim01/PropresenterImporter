A baby boy in a Virgin’s womb
That’s what you did
 
What you did
 
Dry bones come alive and live again
That’s what you did
 
What you did
 
From the east you commanded the winds
and separated the red Sea
 
What you did
 
With two fishes and five loaves of bread
a great multitude you fed
 
What you did
 
That was then and now is now
 
Many years has come and gone
The same God
 
The same God that spoke creation into being
Lord your word will never fail, same God
 
Oh…Oh….Oh
 
She was blind now she can see
He was on wheels but can walk again
 
O! Lazarus come forth
 
That’s what you did
 
How could a God so great and mighty make my body
His dwelling place, same God
 
That was then and now is now.
 
Many years has come
Still God ……Yeah
 
Heaven & Earth shall pass away
Lord your word remains the same
 
Same God that spoke creation into being
 
Lord your word will never fail
Same God
