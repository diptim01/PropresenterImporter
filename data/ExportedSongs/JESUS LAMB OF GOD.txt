YOU ARE MY STRENGTH WHEN I AM WEAK
YOU ARE THE TREASURE THAT I SEEK
 
YOU ARE MY ALL IN ALL
 
SEEKING YOU AS A PRECIOUS JEWEL
LORD TO GIVE UP
 
I'D BE A FOOL
YOU ARE MY ALL IN ALL
 
TAKING MY PAIN, MY CROSS, MY SHAME
RISING AGAIN I'LL
 
BLESS YOUR NAME
YOU ARE MY ALL IN ALL
 
WHEN I FALL DOWN
YOU PICK ME UP
 
WHEN I AM DRY
YOU FILL MY CUP
 
YOU ARE MY ALL IN ALL
 
JESUS, LAMB OF GOD
WORTHY IS YOUR NAME (2X)
