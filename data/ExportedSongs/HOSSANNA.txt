EYIN NIKAN L'OGO YE BABA
EYIN NIKAN L'OGO YE
 
YOU are worthy of our praise oh Lord
 
The angels bow down at the thought of You
 
The angels bow down at the thought of You
The darkness gives way to the light for You
 
The price that you paid gives us life brand New
Hosanna forever we worship You
 
Hosanna forever we worship You [2x]
 
For you are the joy that my soul longs for
The lamb that was slain for my sins and the One I adore
 
King of kings, Ruler of everything
Hosanna forever we worship You
 
Hosanna forever we worship You [2x]
 
For your patience and kindness
And favor and mercy
 
And honor and glory
Because you are worthy
 
We can't live without You
We can't breathe without You
 
We can't sing without You
Hosanna Hosanna
 
No greater love in this world but You
No one can compare to the things You do
 
Wherever You go I will follow You
Hosanna forever we worship You
 
Hosanna forever we worship You
 
Someday every tongue shall confess Your name
This house made of clay soon shall pass away
 
Whatever the test You will bring us through
 
Hosanna forever we worship You [4x]
