The multitudes shall gather
To bow before you throne
 
And with one voice we offer
The treasures of our hearts
 
We long to see your face
Let our worship fill your holy
 
Place as we...
 
Sing of your mercy and your love
Sing of your grace and your
Power
 
How great you are our faithful
God
 
Sacrifices we bring are pure and
Holy offerings
 
How great your are our faithful
God
 
How we give you worship
With clean and upright hearts
