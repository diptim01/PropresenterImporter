Remember the words of Jesus
A lesson to be learned
 
Whenever we give ourselves away
He rewards us in return
 
Over and over
 
To everyone who will listen
To those who will believe
 
Giving is more than sacrifice
It's the best way to receive
 
Over and over
 
Give and it will be given unto you
Give and it will be given unto you
 
A good measure pressed down
Shaken together and running over
 
Give and it will be given unto you
