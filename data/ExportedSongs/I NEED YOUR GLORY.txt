So many times I tried my way
but all of the pain didn't go away
 
I realize that only you
could give me this love that is so true
 
So many times I tried my way
but all of the pain didn't go away I realize
 
That only you could give
Me this love that is soTrue
 
I need your glory

Less of me and more of You is what I need
Show me you glory,
 
Show me your power, less of me and more of you is what I need

is what I need, show me your Glory,
 
Show me your Power less of me and more of you
