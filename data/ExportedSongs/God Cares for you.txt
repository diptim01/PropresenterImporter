I know you feel discouraged
Seems like life had got the best of you
 
And every time you turn around
Something else has got you down
 
But there's one thing you need to know
And I'm here to encourage you...
 
God Cares For you…
Yes He cares For you…
 
All though sometimes you have to cry
Over things you can't explain
 
You find your faith being tested
But still you must trust God's Heart
 
He may not come when you want Him
but He's always right on time
 
God Cares For you…
Yes He cares For you…
 
So, when you go through  life's trials
It's alright, He's there
 
Even when you can not feel Him
Trust His heart and know He cares
 
He will Never leave you alone
He'll never forsake you for you're His own
 
God Cares For you…
Yes He cares For you…(x3)
 
He Knows….. He Cares….
and He's always there (X16)
 
God Cares For you…
Yes He cares For you…
