You are the reason I Live
 
You are the reason I Live
You're The One for me
 
You're The One for me
You're The One for me
 
Why should I fear when I have You
Surrounded by your love
 
Your everlasting love
Why should I care what people say
 
Cause they don't know
What You mean to me
 
They don't know
What You mean to me
 
You're the one for me.......
