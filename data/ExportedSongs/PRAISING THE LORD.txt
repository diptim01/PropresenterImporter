Praising the Lord is what i've come to do
and no force on earth can stop me no no
 
Jesus the Lord has won a victory
and set me at liberty.
 
so let us
bow down and worship
 
bow down and worship
bow down and worship him
Jesus the Lord
 
Praising the Lord is what i've come to do
and no force on earth can stop me no no
 
I will praise him Jesus the Lord
exalt Him I've got the victory
 
He has set me free and given me new life
i'll exalt him I've got the liberty
