Hide me now, under Your wings
Cover me, beneath Your mighty hand
 
When the oceans rise and thunders roar
I will soar with You, above the storm
 
Father, You are King over the flood
I will be still, know You are God
 
Find rest my soul, in Christ alone
Know His power, in quietness and trust
 
When the oceans rise and thunders roar
I will soar with You, above the storm
 
When the oceans rise and thunders roar
I will soar with You, above the storm
