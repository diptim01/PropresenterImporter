Oh.......
Let's sing about
 
The wonders of God.
Oh.......
 
Let's sing about
The wonders of God.
 
Let's sing about
The greatness of the Father.
 
Sing about the glory of His Son
And the Holy Spirit
 
Dwelling among us
Let's sing about the wonders of God.
 
The earth and heaven above
Echo the wonder of His love
 
Join the chorus
God is for us
 
The greatest wonder of all.
