How did I make it out
Of all the things  that I was in
 
Almost lost hope
I saw no way that I could win
 
Then YOU rescued me
I should have never doubted YOU
 
My Savior
YOU've always been able,but now I believe
 
I have seen YOUR ability
LORD You have proven to me
 
That YOU're a powerful, powerful GOD
 
Yes HE can solve any test
There's nothing HE won't do for YOU
 
There is none that's too hard
For a powerful, powerful GOD
 
OH OH OH OH OH OH
 
He's a powerful GOD (3x)
 
Yes Yes Yes
He Is A Powerful God
 
Power Power Power
 
JESUS...
 
Yesâ€¦.
