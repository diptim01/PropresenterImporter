If youíd call, I would have answered
The cares of this world has left you dry
 
Itís gotten serious, almost disaster
Deceptive lies,
 
Intoxicated with despair
 
Trying to find the answer anywhere
To and fro asking everyone you know
 
Now come to me
When the world is on your shoulders
 
Come to me, guaranteed to take it over
Thereís nothing too hard
 
No impossibilities if you
come to me
 
Crisis of the heart, it doesnít matter
I am the solution, though it seems so big
 
Pursuits and promises, all addictions, Iíll intervene
 
Intoxicated with despair, trying to find the answer anywhere
 
To and fro asking anyone you know
 
And all you battles Iíll gladly fight
Your torch of hope Iíll promise to light
 
I will never leave you alone
Nor forsake, if you will come
 
Just come to Me
 
When the world is on your shoulders,
Come to me, guaranteed to take it over
 
Come to me, with all your troubles and your tests,
Lay them down, and Iíll promise to do the rest
 
For I am your God, thereís nothing too hard
 
No impossibilities,
If you come, to Me.
