O for a heart to praise my God,
A heart from sin set free,
 
A heart that always feels Thy blood,
So freely for me!
 
A heart resigned, submissive meek,
My great Redeemer's throne,
 
Where only Christ is heard to speak,
Where Jesus reigns alone.
 
A humble lowly contrite heart,
Believing, true and clean;
 
Which neither life nor death can part,
From Him who dwells within!
 
A heart in every thought renewed,
And full of love divine;
 
Perfect and right and pure and good,
A copy Lord of Thine.
 
Thy nature gracious Lord impart;
Come quickly from above,
 
Write Thy new name upon my heart,
Thy new best name of love.
