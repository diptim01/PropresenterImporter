Before I bring my need
I will bring my heart
 
Before I lift my cares
I will lift my arms
 
I wanna know You
I wanna find You
 
In every season
In every moment
 
Before I bring my need
I will bring my heart and seek You First
 
I wanna seek You
I wanna seek You,First
 
I wanna seek You
I wanna seek You,First
 
More than anything I want,
I want You,First
 
Before I speak a word
Let me hear Your voice
 
Ooh, I wanna know You
I wanna find You
 
In every season
In every moment
 
Before I speak a word
I will bring my heart
And seek You First
 
I wanna seek You
I wanna seek You,First
 
I wanna seek You
I wanna seek You,First
 
More than anything I want,
I want You,First
 
You are my treasure and my reward
Let nothing ever come before
 
You are my treasure and my reward
Let nothing ever come before
 
I seek You
First
 
First,I wanna seek You
I wanna seek You
 
First,I wanna keep You
I wanna keep You
 
First,more than anything I want,
I want You First
