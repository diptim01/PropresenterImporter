In Your presence I am content
In Your presence I am content
 
In Your presence there is light
Expressions of Your love
 
Revelations of Your
power and might
 
In Your presence I can bring
A love song offering
 
I'm in the presence of my King
 
I'm in the presence of
my KING
 
Everything we need
 
Everything we need
is here
 
in Your Presence
Oh Oh oo oo
 
Everything we need
is here

My Saviour
Is here right now
 
Sustainer

There is no place like Your presence Lord
No place we'd rather be
 
Everything we need
is here
 
in Your Presence
Oh Oh oo oo
 
Everything we need
is here
 
in Your Presence
JESUS
 
Meet every need unspoken
Heal every broken heart
 
Lift every burden
In Your Presence

Restore what has been stolen
 
Speak peace to every storm
Let there be freedom
 
In Your Presence
JESUS
