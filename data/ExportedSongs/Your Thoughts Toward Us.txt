Your thoughts toward us are beautiful
Your thoughts Lord soothe the soul
 
Like rain refreshing the desert
Deep inside a heart
 
Your thoughts toward us are musical
You sing Your song through us
 
Your thoughts are precious and many
Let the music start
 
Songs of peace
Songs of forgiveness
 
Songs of life everlasting
You make the mountains
 
And create the wind
And You make Your
 
Thoughts known to us
