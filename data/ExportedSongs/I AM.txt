How do you do? I am a sinner
Born into sin and shaped in iniquity
 
Now I believe not who I
was but still not what I shall be
 
You found me and
gave me your name and
 
Things I desired have changed but
Inside you'll see it's still broken pieces
 
Deep in me reaches for you
 
How do you do? I am a beggar
Desperate for more
 
I hunger for your truth
 
See I am shattered
Though I may fall still YOU
 
make all things new
 
YOU speak, the storm, it obeys
and gone is the weight of mistakes
 
Though I still feel YOU continue to heal, look close, and see it(whoa)
 
How do you do?
I am a winner
 
I've lost a few and life's knocked
me to my knees
 
But now I am standing
Not by my power,
 
but your life inside of me
 
Even through seasons and changes
No tear has ever been wasted
 
Misunderstood still it worked for my good
look now and see
 
I am not the old me but still
 
I am so far from perfect
I thought life was worthless
 
Until you showed me who I am
 
Not here by mistake
No luck, only grace
 
I'm on my way to
Who I am,
 
I am
 
I am
Thank God I am
 
I am,  I am
 
I am so far from perfect
I thought life was worthless (yes God)
 
Until you showed me who I am (I am)
 
Not here by mistake
No luck, only grace
 
I'm on my way to
Who I am (and all of you), I am (I'm in love with you)I am (here to worship you), I am (Jesus)
 
Thank God I am (ready to be closer)
I am (ready to go higher), I am
 
I am so far from perfect (so far)
I thought life was worthless (yes)
 
Until you showed me who I am (but you showed me)
Not here by mistake (thank you)
 
No luck, only grace (thank you)
I'm on my way to
 
Who I am (I'm not ashamed), I am (look, I'mnot the same)
I am (I'm letting go of the pain), I am (yes Lord)
 
Thank God I am (more than what you see)
I am (not yet what I shall be), I am
 
Here and I'm closer, praise now is stronger
Stood up to fear, by faith I'm still here
 
Couldn't walk away, love said not todayTimes haven't seen what God has for me
The hurt and the lies, through the pain, through the night
 
Cried and I cried but still I survived
 
Thank YOU
YOU didn't give up on me
 
while I was still in the process
 
Hallelujah God that YOU could see what I couldn't see
Thank YOU
