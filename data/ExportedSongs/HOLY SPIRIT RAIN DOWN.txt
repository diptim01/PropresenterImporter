HOLY SPIRIT
RAIN DOWN, RAIN DOWN
 
OH COMFORTER AND FRIEND
 
HOW WE NEED YOUR  TOUCH AGAIN
 
HOLY SPIRIT
RAIN DOWN, RAIN DOWN
 
LET YOUR POWER FALL
LET YOUR VOICE BE HEARD
 
COME AND CHANGE
OUR HEARTS
 
AS WE STAND ON YOUR WORD
 
HOLY SPIRIT RAIN DOWN
 
NO EYE HATH SEEN,
NO EAR HATH HEARD
 
NO MIND CAN KNOW
WHAT GOD HAS IN STORE
 
SO OPEN UP HEAVEN,
OPEN IT WIDE
 
OVER YOUR CHURCH
AND OVER OUR LIVES,
 
HOLY SPIRIT RAIN DOWN,
RAIN DOWN
