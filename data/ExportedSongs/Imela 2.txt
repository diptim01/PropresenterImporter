Oh God
Your love has never changed
 
You remain the same
Everlasting God you reign
 
Alpha...
Omega...
 
Beginning and the end
That's just who you are
 
Imela Imela Imela
For all you've done for me
 
Imela Imela
If not for your grace where would I be
 
By your Grace I'm Alive ,
Your Grace frees me to Worship,
 
Your Grace, there is Peace,
if not for Your Grace, where would I be.â€Ž
