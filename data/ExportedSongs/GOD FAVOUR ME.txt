Love is patient, caring. Love is Kind. Love is felt most when it's genuine, But I've had my share of love, abuse,
Manipulated and it's strength misued,
 
And I can't help but give you glory
 
When I think about my story, and I Know you favored me
Because my enemies did try but couldn't triumph over me
 
Yes did try but couldn't triumph over me
 
when I think about my story,
and I know you favored me
 
because my enemies did try but couldn't triumph over me
Yes they did try but couldn't triumph over me.
 
They whispered, conspired, they told their lies (God favors me) 
My character, my integrity, my faith in
(God favors me)
 
Will not fall, will not bend, won√≠t compromise
(God favors me)
 
I speak life and prosperity and I speak health (God favors me)
 
Say Yes (Yes), Yes (Yes), Yes (Yes) God favors me
Say Yes (Yes), Yes (Yes), Say Yes (Yes) God favors me
 
God favors me
