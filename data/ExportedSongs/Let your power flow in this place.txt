Let your power flow in this place
Let your healing come in this place
 
I call for signs and wonders in this place
Let your presence show in this place, oh yeah
 
Anointing fall on me
Your mercy will I seek
 
Just like the days when power passed the sea
Your power remains the same
 
Yes! You never change
