May our homes be filled with dancing
May our streets be filled with joy
 
May injustice bow to JESUS
As the people turn and pray
 
May our light shine in the darkness
As we walk in before the cross
 
May our glory fill the whole Earth
As the water over the seas.
 
From the mountain
to the valley
 
Hear our praises
rise to you
 
From the heaven
to the nations
 
Hear our singing
fill the air
 
Halleluyah
Halleluyah
 
From the mountain
to the valley
 
Hear our praises
rise to you
 
From the heaven
to the nations
 
Hear our singing
fill the air
