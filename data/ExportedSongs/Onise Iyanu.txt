Onise Iyanu
(The Miracle Worker)
 
You're the God of Awesome wonders
 
I have tasted of Your power
 
Onise Iyanu
(The Miracle Worker)
 
You have shown me so much mercy
So much more than I deserve
 
My eyes have seen….My ears have heard
The wonders of Your grace
 
Creation bows in awe of You...
And we join to give You praise...
 
The words You speak turns things around
Your outstretched arm has lifted me
 
You took away the chains and cords
That held me bound
 
Omniscient, Omnipotent
The one who does great things
 
When I behold the things You do
I just can’t hold back my praise
 
The words You speak turns things around
Your outstretched arm has lifted me
 
You took away the chains and cords
That held me bound
