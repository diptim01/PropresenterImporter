The eyes of the Lord
Are on those who fear Him
 
Lord we put our trust in You
The words of the Lord
 
Are with those who hear Him
Lord we put our trust in You
 
The hands of the Lord
Protection and strength
 
Are with those who trust in the Lord
 
Your love never fails
It rests upon us
 
Your love never fails
It's always true
 
Your love never fails
It rests upon us oh Lord
 
As we put our trust in You
As we put our trust in You
