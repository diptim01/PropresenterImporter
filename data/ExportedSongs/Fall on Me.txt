Spirit of peace
Sent by the Father's hand
 
Change my life with Your presence
Make me whole
 
Pour over me
Like rain on a thirsty land
 
Make a stream in the desert
Of my soul
 
Holy Spirit fall
Fall on me
 
Holy Spirit fall
Fall on me
 
On my hands
On my feet
 
On my heart
Every part of me
 
Falling In Love With Jesus Lyrics
 
Falling In Love With Jesus
Falling In Love With Jesus
 
Falling In Love With Jesus
Was The Best Thing
 
I Ever, Ever Done
 
In His Arms I Feel Protected
In His Arms Never Disconnected (No No)
 
In His Arms I Feel Protected
There's No Place
 
I'd Rather Rather Be
