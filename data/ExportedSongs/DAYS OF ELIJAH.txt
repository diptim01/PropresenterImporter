THESE ARE THE DAYS OF ELIJAH
DECLARING THE WORD OF THE LORD
 
AND THESE ARE THE DAYS OF YOUR SERVANT MOSES,RIGHTEOUSNESS BEING RESTORED
 
AND THESE ARE THE
DAYS OF GREAT TRIALS,
 
OF FAMINE, AND DARKNESS, AND SWORD
 
STILL WE ARE THE VOICE IN THE DESERT
 
CRYING
PREPARE YE THE WAY OF THE LORD
 
BEHOLD HE COMES
RIDING ON THE CLOUDS
 
SHINING LIKE THE SUN
AT THE TRUMPET'S CALL
 
LIFT YOUR VOICE
IT'S THE YEAR OF JUBILEE
 
OUT OF ZION HILLS
SALVATION COMES
 
THERE IS NO GOD LIKE JEHOVAH!
 
AND THESE ARE THE DAYS OF EZEKIEL
THE DRY BONES BECOMING AS FLESH
 
AND THESE ARE THE DAYS
OF YOUR SERVANT DAVID
 
REBUILDING THE TEMPLE OF PRAISE
 
AND THESE ARE THE DAYS OF THE HARVEST
 
THE FIELD ARE
AS WHITE IN YOUR WORD
 
AND WE ARE THE
LABOURERS IN YOUR VINEYARD
 
DECLARING THE
WORD OF THE LORD
 
BEHOLD HE COMES
RIDING ON THE CLOUDS
 
SHINING LIKE THE SUN
AT THE TRUMPET'S CALL
 
LIFT YOUR VOICE
IT'S THE YEAR OF JUBILEE
 
OUT OF ZION HILLS
SALVATION COMES
 
THERE IS NO GOD LIKE JEHOVAH!
