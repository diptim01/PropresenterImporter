There was so much on my mind
Searching for that peace
 
But the peace I could not find
 
So then I kneeled down to pray
Praying help me please
 
But then he said you don't have to cry
'Cause I'll supply all your needs
 
As soon as I stop worrying
Worrying how the story ends
 
I let go and I let God
Let God have His way
 
That's when things start happening
When I stopped looking at back then
 
I let go and I let God
Let God have his way
