WE BRING THE SACRIFICE OF PRAISE
INTO THE HOUSE OF THE LORD
 
AS WE OFFER UNTO THEE
THE SCARIFICES OF THANKSGIVING
 
AS WE OFFER UNTO THEE
THE SCARIFICES OF PRAISE
 
We cannot be cursed for the shout of a king is among us.
 
We cannot be cursed
For the shout of a King is among us.
 
The weapons of hell will not prosper
For the shout of the King is among us.
