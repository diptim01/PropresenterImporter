LIKE THE WOMAN AT THE WELL
I WAS SEEKING
 
FOR THINGS THAT COULD NOT SATISFY
BUT WHEN I HEARD MY SAVIOUR SPEAKING
 
DRAW FROM THE WELL
THAT NEVER SHALL RUN DRY
 
FILL MY CUP LORD
I LIFT IT UP LORD
 
COME AND QUENCH
THIS THIRSTING OF MY SOUL,
 
BREAD OF HEAVEN FILL ME
TILL I WANT NO MORE
 
FILL MY CUP FILL IT UP
AND MAKE ME WHOLE
 
BREAD OF HEAVEN
