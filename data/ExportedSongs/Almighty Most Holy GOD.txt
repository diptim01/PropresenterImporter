Almighty Most Holy GOD
Faithful through the agesAlmighty Most Holy LORD
 
Glorious Almighty GOD
 
The beast of the field
The birds of the air
 
Are silent to call out Your name
The earth has no voice and I have no choice
 
But to magnify GOD unashamed
 
Let the rocks be kept silent for one more day
Let the whole world sing out
 
Let the people say
