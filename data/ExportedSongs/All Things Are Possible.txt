It doesn't matter you're going through
It doesn't matter how far you've gone
 
God's arms are always open wide
All you you need is to believe
 
All things are possible
When you call on His name
 
All things are possible
in Jesus name
 
Mountain will crumble
Chain shall be broken
 
All things are possible in Jesus name
(x2)
