He is jealous for me
Loves like a hurricane,
 
Bending beneath the weight of
His wind and mercy
 
When all of a sudden, I am unaware of these afflictions eclipsed by glory
 
And I realize just how beautiful You are And how great your affections are for me.
 
Oh, how He loves us so
Oh, how He loves us
How He loves us so.
 
Yeah, He loves us
Oh, how He loves us
 
Oh, how He loves us
Oh, how He loves.
 
We are His portion and He is our prize,
Drawn to redemption by the grace in His eyes
 
If grace is an ocean, we're all sinking
So heaven meets earth like a sloppy wet kiss and my heart turns violently inside of my chest
 
I don't have time to maintain these regrets
When I think about the way
 
Oh, how He loves us so
Oh, how He loves us
How He loves us so.
 
Yeah, He loves us
Oh, how He loves us
 
Oh, how He loves us
Oh, how He loves.
