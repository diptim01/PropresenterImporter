Marvelous grace of our loving Lord,
Grace that exceeds our sin and our guilt,
 
Yonder on Calvary's mount outpoured,
There where the blood of the Lamb was spilt
 
Sin and despair like the sea waves cold,
Threaten the soul with infinite loss;
 
Grace that is greater, yes, grace untold,
Points to the refuge, the mighty cross.
 
Dark is the stain that we cannot hide,
What can avail to wash it away?
 
Look! there is flowing a crimson tide;
Whiter than snow you may be today.
 
Marvelous, infinite, matchless grace,
Freely bestowed on all who believe;
 
All who are longing to see His face,
Will you this moment His grace receive?
 
Grace, Grace, God's grace,
Grace that will pardon and cleanse within;
 
Grace, Grace, God's grace,
Grace that is greater than all our sin.
 
Mary, did you know
 
Mary, did you know that your Baby Boy
would one day walk on water?
 
Mary, did you know that your Baby Boy
would save our sons and daughters?
 
Did you know that your Baby Boy
has come to make you new?
 
This Child that you delivered will soon deliver you.
 
Mary, did you know that your Baby Boy
will give sight to a blind man?
 
Mary, did you know that your Baby Boy
will calm the storm with His hand?
 
Did you know that your Baby Boy
has walked where angels trod?
 
When you kiss your little Baby
you kissed the face of God?
 
Mary did you know.. Ooo Ooo Ooo
 
The blind will see.
The deaf will hear.
 
The dead will live again.
The lame will leap.
 
The dumb will speak
The praises of The Lamb.
 
Mary, did you know that your Baby Boy
is Lord of all creation?
 
Mary, did you know that your Baby Boy
would one day rule the nations?
 
Did you know that your Baby Boy
is heaven's perfect Lamb?
 
The sleeping Child you're holding is the great I AM...
