Because He lives, (He lives) oh, I can face tomorrow
 
Because He lives, (He lives), all my fear is gone
 
Because He lives, (He lives), I live above all fear and sorrow
 
Because He lives, (He lives), He lives, (He lives) in me (in me),
 
I can face tomorrow
 
Because He lives, (He lives), He lives, (He lives) in me (in me),
 
All my fear is gone
 
If God is dead, who regulates the time and the seasons?
 
If God is dead, then who puts a child in the womb?
 
If God is dead, then who created the heaven and earth?
 
Oh! My God is not dead, 'cause I can see Him everywhere
 
I can see Him in the mountain
Feel Him in the wind
 
See Him in my baby
Anytime he calls me daddy
 
I can see Him and Your eyes watching over me
Just a wink will make all things alright
 
Because He lives, (He lives) oh, I can face tomorrow
 
Because He lives, (He lives), all my fear is gone
 
Because He lives, (He lives), I live above all fear and sorrow
 
Because He lives, (He lives), He lives, (He lives) in me (in me),
 
I can face tomorrow
 
Because He lives, (He lives), He lives, (He lives) in me (in me),
 
All my fear is gone
I hear Your voice
 
In the raging storm
Just one look in Your eyes
 
Makes everything alright
 
Because He lives, (He lives) oh, I can face tomorrow
 
Because He lives, (He lives), all my fear is gone
 
Because He lives, (He lives), I live above all fear and sorrow
 
Because You live, (You live), You live, (You live) in me (in me)
 
I can do all things
 
Because He lives, (He lives), He lives, (He lives) in me (in me),
 
I can face tomorrow
 
Because He lives, I can climb every mountain high
I can do all things
 
He woke me up this morning
Set me on my way
 
Put food on my table
You can't tell me God is dead
 
He lives, He lives
He lives in me, me, me
