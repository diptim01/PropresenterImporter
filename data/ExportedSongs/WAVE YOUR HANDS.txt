WHEN TRIALS, THEY COME TO DISCOURAGE YOU TRY TO MAKE A WAY
 
BUT JESUS SAID I WILL DELIVER
YOU FROM ALL OF THEM
 
THERE IS NO NEED TO WORRY
ABOUT IT JUST BELIEVE GOD WILL
 
BRING YOU OUT YEAH!!!
 
WAVE YOUR HANDS AND PRAISE THE LORD
IF YOU KNOW THE LORD'S BEEN GOOD TO YOU
 
WAVE YOUR HANDS AND
PRAISE THE LORD(2X)
 
WHEN TRIALS, HEY COME TO DISCOURAGE YOU TRY TO MAKE A WAY.
 
BUT JESUS SAID I WILL DELIVER YOU FROM ALL
 
THERE IS NO NEED TO WORRY
ABOUT IT JUST BELIEVE GOD WILL
 
BRING YOU OUT YEAH
