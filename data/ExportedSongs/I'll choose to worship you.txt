Have you read the papers, do you hear what they say?
Rising unemployment, cost of living everyday is getting high
 
Another suicide bomber in a bus with thirty kids,
It kinda makes me wonder what those children ever did
 
yet we still go to church and sing shout to the Lord
and we lift up holy hands and we're reading his word
 
now I am sitting by my piano with nothing to play
but that doesn't change the fact that God is God anyway
 
So i sing bless ye the Lord through my trials and all my troubles, I have come with a heart of worship
 
for the gift of your son, for the grace to fight my battles
i have come to you with thanksgiving
 
hear my broken cry, see my broken spirit
but in every situation, I'll still choose to worship you .
 
Please forgive me this is not your normal worship song
i try to write a simple song that me and everyone can sing along
 
but i realize that there is something about praise
it shouldn't only come when all is seemingly okay
 
so when you start to cry, like your life is a mess
don't be scared, don't be discouraged it is only a test
 
why don't you lift up your voice to the ears of your God and release sweet smelling savour from your alabaster box
 
Singing bless ye the lord, through my trials and all my troubles, I have come with a heart of worship
 
for the gift of your son, for the grace to fight my battles
i have come to you with thanksgiving
 
hear my broken cry, see my broken spirit
but in every situation, I'll still choose to worship you .
 
I worship you, Almighty God, what a mighty God we serve, who is there like you Jesus, lover of my soul?
 
only God to whom all praise is due,
blessed be the... he will make a ...you are highly... oooo
 
Bless ye the lord, through my trials and all my troubles, I have come with a heart of worship
 
for the gift of your son, for the grace to fight my battles
i have come to you with thanksgiving
 
singing bless ye the lord, through my trials and all my troubles I have come with a heart of worship
 
for the gift of your son, for the grace to fight my battles, I have come to you with thanks giving,
 
saying, hear my humble cry, see my broken spirit,
but in every situation, i'll still choose to worship You. only You
