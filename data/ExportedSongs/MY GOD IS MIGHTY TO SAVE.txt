Everyone needs compassion
A love that's never failing,
 
let mercy fall on me
 
Everyone needs forgiveness
The kindness of a Saviour,
 
the hope of nations
 
So take me as You find me
All my fears and failures,
 
fill my life again
I give my life to follow
 
Everything I believe in,
and now I surrender,
 
Saviour, He can move the mountains
My God is mighty to save,
 
He is mighty to save
 
Forever, author of Salvation
He rose and conquered  the grave,
 
Jesus conquered the grave
 
Shine Your light and
let the whole world see,
 
we're singing
For the glory of the risen King,
 
Jesus
Shine Your light and
 
let the whole world see,
 
we're singing
For the glory of the risen King
