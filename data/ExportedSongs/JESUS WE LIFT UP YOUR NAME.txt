I wanna sing of Your love
Wanna sing of Your mercy
 
I wanna tell the whole world
Of the greatness of You
 
So I'll sing of Your love
And I'll sing of Your mercy
 
So I'll sing of Your love
And I'll sing of Your mercy
 
And I'll tell the whole world
Of the greatness of You
 
Jesus, we lift up Your name
 
Your name is higher than the heavens
Greater than the nations Jesus
