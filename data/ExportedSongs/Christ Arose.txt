Low in the grave He lay, Jesus my Saviour!
Waiting the coming day, Jesus my Lord!
 
Vainly they watch His bed, Jesus my Saviour!
Vainly they seal the dead, Jesus my Lord!
 
Death cannot keep His prey, Jesus my Saviour!
He tore the bars away, Jesus my Lord!
 
Up from the grave He arose,
With a mighty triumph o'er His foes;
 
He arose a victor from the dark domain
And He lives forever with His saints to reign.
 
He arose! He arose!
Hallelujah! Christ arose!
