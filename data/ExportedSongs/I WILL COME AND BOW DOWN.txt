I will come and bow down,
And give you all the praise
 
There is no one else like you…..
You are worthy of our praise.
 
Only You deserve our praise…..
We have come to worship at Your feet…..
 
Jesus You are the lover of my soul…..
Jesus I will never let You go…..
 
You have taken me from the marry clay…..
You set my feet upon the rock, now i know…..
 
I love You….. I need You
Though my work before i" never let You
 
Never let You Go….. (X6)
