I have listened to you,
I have heard your request
 
I've come to tell you
that it's only a test;
 
Just hold on,
through your storm, be strong,
 
Just hold on,
this test is your storm,
 
But it won't be long,
go through, hold on.
 
So your daughter won't hear you,
Your son could care less,
 
Seems they've done all to hurt you,
but it's only a test;
 
Just hold on,
through your storm, be strong,
 
And hold on, this test is your storm,
 
But it won't be long, go through, hold on.
 
Don't you know the darkest time in your life,
is just before, the break
(Just before, the break of dawn)
 
God promises all your battles,
I will fight if you just
 
Just hold on, hold on, hold on.
 
Your tears have been plenty
in the still of the night,
 
You've prayed, now your empty
just too weak to fight.
 
Just hold on, through your storm,
be strong and hold on,
 
This test is your storm, but it won't be long,
Go through, hold on.
 
You say you've been wounded,
You've given your best,
 
You've been misunderstood,
but it's only a test,
 
(This test is your storm),
(it won't be long, go through, hold on).
 
I'm able to deliver
Hold on, hold on x2
 
I'm able, I can help you,
Hold on, hold on.
 
I'm able, I can heal you,
Hold on, hold on
 
Hold on,Hold on
Hold on hold on x4
 
Never the less,
It's only a test, hold on, hold on. x3
 
I have listened to you,
I have heard your request,
 
I've come to tell you, that it's only a test;
 
Just hold on, through your storm, be strong,
 
And hold on, this test is your storm,
 
But it won't be long, go through, hold on.
