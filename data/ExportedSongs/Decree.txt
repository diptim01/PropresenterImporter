What do you do when people talk about pain
What do you say when people talk about lack,
 
do you just join them and chit chat
or do you say that everything would be fine
 
what do you do when all around you is gray,
do you just give in to the pressure and cry? or do you trust Him and give Him the praise,
 
knowing He makes everything okay
 
I declare, I decree, I confess, (it is well with my soul) 2X
I declare, I decree, I confess, (it is well with my soul) 3x
 
It is well, it is well, it is well with my soul
With my soul, it is well, it is well, it is well with my soul
 
What do you do when all hope seems lost?
What do you do when the one you love’s dead and gone
 
do you just give in and throw in the towel?
Or do you say ‘it is well with my soul’
What do you do when the sickness won’t go?
 
What do you say when the pain’s hard to bear, do you just trust Him and give Him the praise,
 
So watch what you say and do
for there’s power in your tongue
 
No! Don’t give up, God’s not through with you
You just hold on, you stay strong oh
